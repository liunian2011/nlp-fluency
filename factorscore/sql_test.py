The Vertisols of the Purna Valley, which cover the districts of Amravati, Akola and Buldhana in the state of Maharashtra, India, lack any perceptible evidence of salt efflorescence on the soil surface which would indicate the presence of salt, but the drainage conditions are poor. The limited data available indicate that the adverse physical condition of the soils is due to their poor hydraulic conductivity (HC), which is impaired by sodium in the exchange complex. However, the factors and processes that are inherently related to the development of sodicity in these shrink-swell soils are not yet understood. In order to establish the cause-effect relationship, eight Vertisol pedons from methodically selected sites were studied morphometrically in the field, and for their sodicity-related physical and chemical properties in the laboratory.



The soils are deep, calcareous, clayey and very dark greyish brown to dark brown in colour. Cracks extend up to the slickenside zones in soils of Pedons 1–3 in the northeastern area of the valley, while they cut through the slickenside zones in soils of Pedons 4–8 in the southwest. The slickenside faces were larger in the soils of the southwest than in those of the northeast. All these soils meet the specifications of the Vertisols order of soil taxonomy.



Saturation extracts of the soils had very low electrical conductivity (ECe ⩽ 2 ds m−1). They ranged from moderately alkaline in the northeast, Pedons 1–3, to strongly alkaline in the southwest, pedons 4–8. In soils from the northeast the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) was less than 5 throughout the depth of the pedons, whereas in other soils it was up to 6 in the surface horizons and between 7 and 26 in the subsoil horizons; four of these soils qualified as sodic according to the criteria of the United States Salinity Laboratory. The inherently low hydraulic conductivity was due to the dispersion of clay particles caused by a high percentage of exchangeable magnesium (EMP) in the highly smectitic soils, and also to a slight increase in ESP (⩾5).



The results of this study suggest that ESP 5 should be used as the lower limit for sodic subgroups of Vertisols, rather than ESP 15 as given in Keys to Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1994). This is because there are severe limitations to the use of such soils owing to the development of adverse physical conditions even at such a low ESP. The authors emphasize the need to keep this fact in mind during future land resource management programmes on the soils of this valley as well as on similar soils occurring elsewhere.



The development of sodicity in the soils of the southwestern part of the valley has been attributed to the semi-arid climatic conditions that have induced the pedogenetic process of depletion of calcium ions from the soil solution in the form of calcium carbonate, thereby resulting in an increase of both the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and the ESP with pedon depth. This chemical degradation, which affects the sodicity of Vertisols, appears to be a basic process that needs to be recognised in the future along with those already described as natural processes of soil degradation."""

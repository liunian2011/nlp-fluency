    "The problem of two phase bio-convective nano fluid flow past a vertical stretching flat surface in presence of volume fraction of the dust particles has been investigated. Governing partial differential equations of the problem for both fluid and dust phases are transformed into ordinary differential equations using suitable similarity transformations. The resulting non-linear differential equations are solved numerically using MATLAB built-in bvp4c solver scheme. The velocity, temperature of fluid motion and concentration of micro-organisms are presented graphically for various flow parameters. Coefficient of local skin friction, local Nusselt number and local density number of the micro-organisms are calculated and presented in tables for various parameters.",
    "With an estimated 50% of global land held, used, or otherwise managed by communities, interfacing indigenous, customary, and informal land tenure systems with official land administration systems is critical to achieving universal land tenure security at a global scale. The complexity and organic nature of these tenure systems, however, makes their modelling and documentation within standard, generic land administration systems extremely difficult. This paper presents a model that loosely integrates a Local Domain Model (LDM) developed for a Maasai community in Kenya with the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM). The LDM is an ontological schema which captures local knowledge in a systematic, formal way that is directly or indirectly relevant to land administration. The integration with LADM is achieved through an ontological schema called the Adaptor Model. The concept of conditional RRR (Rights, Restrictions, Responsibilities) is introduced within the Adaptor Model to express the dynamics of social tenures. The three domain models LDM, LADM, Adaptor Model are used in the community-based land tenure recording tool SmartSkeMa. Four implementation examples demonstrate how the case-specific LDM extends the range of concepts representable in LADM in order to meet land administration needs from the local community’s perspective. A panel of land administration experts found the LDM model and the functionality of the Adaptor Model to be fit-for-purpose for the Kenyan case and to be addressing an important gap in the land administration tools landscape.",
    "The Bolnisi district is a distinct tectonic zone of the Lesser Caucasus, which is considered to represent the eastern extremity of the Turkish Eastern Pontides. Late Cretaceous, low-K, calc-alkaline to high-K rhyolite of the Mashavera and Gasandami Suites is the predominant rock type of the district, and is accompanied by subsidiary dacite, and rare high-alumina basalt and trachyandesite of the Tandzia Suite. The Mashavera and Gasandami rhyolite and dacite have yielded U-Pb LA-ICP-MS and TIMS zircon ages between 87.14 ± 0.16 and 81.64 ± 0.94 Ma, which are in line with the Coniacan-Santonian ages of radiolarian fauna of the Mashavera Suite. The felsic rocks of the Mashavera and Gasandami Suites were deposited during a ~6.6 m.y.-long silicic magmatic flare-up event, which together with the Tandzia Suite mafic rocks, documents Late Cretaceous bimodal magmatism in an extensional tectonic setting. Trace element data indicate that high Y-Zr, low- to high-silica rhyolite and dacite, and low Y-Zr high-silica rhyolite have been erupted, respectively, from coeval deep and shallow crustal reservoirs. The rocks of the bimodal magmatic event are overlain by high-K volcanic rocks of the Campanian Shorsholeti Suite, which have been erupted during slab roll-back and steepening, from magmas produced by deep melting of a metasomatised mantle. Eocene postcollisional felsic intrusions crosscut the Late Cretaceous rock. The Coniacian to early Campanian bimodal magmatism, and the subsequent high-K magmatism of the Bolnisi district are contemporaneous and share geochemical characteristics with the Late Cretaceous magmatism of the Eastern Pontides. It documents the existence of a Late Cretaceous regional silicic magmatic province, and subsequent high-K magmatism during slab steepening. This regional magmatic evolution coincided with the opening of the Black Sea and the Adjara-Trialeti basins. This evolution was coeval with the wanning stages of northern Neotethyan subduction, after a ~40 m.y.-long magmatic lull along the southern Eurasian convergent margin. Early Eocene adakite-like magmatism affected both the Bolnisi district and the Eastern Pontides, demonstrating a common postcollisional magmatic evolution.",
    "Horn Island, one of the two most stable barriers along the Mississippi-Alabama chain (Cat, East and West Ship, Horn, West Petit Bois, Petit Bois, and Dauphin), provides critical habitat, helps regulate estuarine conditions in the Mississippi Sound, and reduces wave energy and storm surge before they reach the mainland shore. However, important details of the formation and evolution of the island in response to sea-level rise, storms, and antecedent geology remain unclear. This study integrates 2200 km of high-resolution geophysical data, 35 sediment cores, and 18 radiocarbon ages to better understand the geologic history of the island. Incised valleys of the Biloxi and Pascagoula Rivers underlie Horn Island and played a profound role in the evolution of the system. Within the incised valleys, sandy paleochannel deposits represent potential sediment sources during island development. Scour associated with wave and tidal ravinement processes liberated sand from the paleochannels and along with numerous other sizable sand sources on the shelf contributed to the formation and continued maintenance of Horn Island. Based on radiocarbon ages, transgressive ephemeral islands/shoals with no preserved shoreface existed at least 8000 cal yr BP and were frequently overwashed when sea-level rise rates were ~ 4–5 mm/yr. Approximately 5000 cal yr BP, coinciding with a deceleration in sea-level rise to about 1.4 mm/yr and attendant increased sand supply, radiocarbon ages associated with Horn Island's barrier complex and lower shoreface indicate a period of island stabilization. Seismic and sediment core data show a long history of westward lateral migration by longshore currents through tidal ravinement and inlet fill. Subsurface sand packages associated with tidal inlet fill and paleochannels are available for ravinement and may be important sand sources for Horn Island to maintain subaerial exposure with the expected accelerated future sea-level rise.",
    "Investigating on new method for Source-to-Sink study by integrating modern system and subsurface interpretation, establishment of the quantitative coupling model from source to sink, and form industrial application standard have long been the research trends of Source-to-Sink system in continental basins. Here the symmetrical and asymmetrical conceptual source-to-sink coupling models (i.e., Symmetrical Dumbbell Type and Asymmetrical Dumbbell Type) are proposed to respond to diverse geomorphology types (i.e., convergent and unitary incised type) based on the morphological and digital proportion between catchment-drainage unit of upstream and sediment-fan of downstream, then summarize and extract the two models by contrasting a modern source-to-sink system of Hovd Central Uplift in northwestern Mongolia as well as an ancient source-to-sink system of Huizhou-Lufeng Lower Uplift in Pearl River Mouth Basin, South China Sea. In the practical study, the satellite remote sensing and Google geological map are used to deconstruct the modern case and combine the Google-topographic-map, well log data, core data and seismic-geomorphology analysis to dissect the ancient case analogously. This paper mainly discusses morphological proportional ranges of catchment acreage (Asource) and sediment fan acreage (Ssink), the relativity between topographic gradient (Gsource) and the source ratio (Rsource=AsourceAsource+Ssink), and the physical properties of sedimentary sand-body associated with diverse geomorphologic types in continental lacustrine basins. Therefrom, it is concluded that the proportion (P=Asource:Ssink) between catchment-drainage segment of source area (Asource) and sediment-fan of depositional sink (Ssink) is over 1:1 in Symmetrical Dumbbell Type source-to-sink coupling model, which is commonly between 1:1.1 and 1:1.6; However, it is below 1:1 in Asymmetrical Dumbbell Type source-to-sink coupling model, which is generally between 1:0.6 and 1:0.9; and there is an evident negative correlation between topographic gradient (Gsource) and the source ratio (Rsource). Finally, these results reveal that the reservoir formed by Symmetrical Dumbbell Type source-to-sink coupling model performs much more superiority. In summary, the two coupling models have not only supplied a new insight into the research on sandy-sediments transport and distribution, but also defined the directions for better finding favourable sand bodies (reservoir) when exploring oil and gas.",
    "Abstract For the first time we introduce an error estimator for the numerical approximation of the equations describing the dynamics of sea ice. The idea of the estimator is to identify different error contributions coming from spatial and temporal discretization as well as from the splitting in time of the ice momentum equations from further parts of the coupled system. The novelty of the error estimator lies in the consideration of the splitting error, which turns out to be dominant with increasing mesh resolution. Errors are measured in user specified functional outputs like the total sea ice extent. The error estimator is based on the dual weighted residual method that asks for the solution of an additional dual problem for obtaining sensitivity information. Estimated errors can be used to validate the accuracy of the solution and, more relevant, to reduce the discretization error by guiding an adaptive algorithm that optimally balances the mesh size and the time step size to increase the efficiency of the simulation.",
    "The eastern part of the Western Carpathians orogenic wedge covering the territory eastward from the 20° meridian could serve as an example for close relation between basement rock structural anisotropy and the neotectonic morphostructural pattern. The neotectonic evolution of the region has been guided by crustal deformations of the entire main Western Carpathian fault systems, defined by steeply dipping faults of NE-SW, NW-SE, S–N and E-W directions. The fault sets bound morphostructural units and form the base for the Quaternary neotectonic activity and landscape development of the region. Closely linked to Western Carpathian lineaments they reflect both the Moho topography and directional orientation of adjoining platform margins. The fault sets represent inherited, poly-stage structures genetically correlating to Cretaceous fold pattern of the Western Carpathians being repeatedly reactivated during Cenozoic times. Summarising vertical movement ratios among neotectonic units, particularly between the highest uplifted/subsiding blocks, we have found the maximal Quaternary movements rate of the region reaching ca 1315 m and neotectonic movements rate of 1710 m.",

    "The synthesis of 1,1-dibutoxyethane or acetaldehyde dibutylacetal was studied in a batch reactor by reacting butanol and acetaldehyde in a liquid phase, using Amberlyst-15 as the catalyst. The reaction equilibrium constant was experimentally determined in the temperature range 20−40 °C at 6 atm, where Ka = 0.00959 exp[1755.3/T (K)]. The standard properties of the reaction at 298.15 K were estimated: ΔH° = −14.59 kJ mol−1, ΔG° = −3.07 kJ mol−1, and ΔS° = −38.64 J mol−1 K−1. Kinetic experiments were performed in the temperature range 10−50 °C at 6 atm. A two-parameter kinetic law based on a Langmuir−Hinshelwood rate expression, using activity coefficients from the UNIFAC method, was used. The kinetic parameters are kc = 2.39 × 109 exp[−6200.9/T (K)] (mol gcat−1 min−1) and ks,D = 2.25 × 10−4 exp[3303.1/T (K)]. The activation energy of the reaction is 51.55 kJ mol−1. This work is an important step for further implementation of an integrated reaction−separation process, such as a simulated moving-bed reactor.",
    "The aim of this study was to formulate, develop, and determine the behavior of nanostructured protective coating systems, fireproof and environmentally friendly, suitable for the protection of metallic substrates. The results allowed concluding that the di- and tripigmented formulations based on laminar zinc, either alone or mixed with nanozinc, showed an excellent corrosion resistance when a nanostructured self-cured inorganic silicate (high silica/alkali ratio) was selected as the film forming material. Coating systems included a sealer of low permeability, which was based on the same film forming material that primers and on laminar pigments. Intumescent coatings were manufactured and then applied on the sealer; in this study, two types of products in an aqueous single package were formulated. The anticorrosive capacity was evaluated in a salt spraying (fog) chamber and in a 100% relative humidity cabinet while the performance against the fire action was determined by estimating the limiting oxygen index in the LOI cabinet, the flame advance in an inclined tunnel, and, finally, the thermal conductivity in a UL 94 flame chamber; in the last test, the degree of intumescence was also assessed. The results showed an excellent ability for corrosion controlling and, in addition, a good performance against the fire action of some of the no pollutant coating systems designed.",
    "A new route for the synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) from isobutane using a single catalytic system has been developed. The key of the process is the use of a bifunctional material, Al-TS-1, capable of catalyzing the liquid-phase oxidation of isobutane with H2O2 and subsequently the etherification with methanol. The procedure carried out, simultaneously or sequentially, both reactions (oxidation and acid catalysis) as well as the influence of the reaction parameters has been studied. A two-stage process at two temperature levels was selected, according to the results obtained by studying both reactions separately. In addition, the influence of other reaction parameters, such as reactant molar ratios, solvent concentration, and catalyst composition, has been investigated to establish the optimum conditions to yield MTBE.",
    "Studies were made on the polymorphism of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene derivatives having amino acid groups on the lower rim to stabilize their hydrophilic pseudocavity by circular intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The calixarenes exhibit a polymorphic transformation upon heating in the solid state. This transformation is controlled by the thermal history of solids, accompanying the change on the conformation of the calixarene skeleton and also the change of hydrogen bonding in the hydrophilic pseudocavity.",
    "A series of 6-aryl-4,5-heterocyclic-fused pyridazinones were designed and synthesized as selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) IV inhibitors. Biological evaluation of these compounds demonstrated a good selectivity profile toward the PDE IV family and greatly attenuated affinity for the Rolipram high-affinity binding site that seems to be responsible for undesiderable side effects. Structure−activity relationships (SARs) studies showed that the presence of an ethyl group at pyridazine N-2 is associated with the best potency and selectivity profile.",
    "A new strategy has been developed for conjugation of peptides to oligonucleotides. The method is based on the “native ligation” of an N-terminal thioester-functionalized peptide to a 5‘-cysteinyl oligonucleotide. Two new reagents were synthesized for use in solid-phase peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis, respectively. Pentafluorophenyl S-benzylthiosuccinate was used in the final coupling step in standard Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide assembly. Deprotection with trifluoracetic acid generated in solution peptides substituted with an N-terminal S-benzylthiosuccinyl moiety. O-trans-4-(N-α-Fmoc-S-tert-butylsulfenyl-l-cysteinyl)aminocyclohexyl O-2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite was used in the final coupling step in standard phosphoramidite solid-phase oligonucleotide assembly. Deprotection with aqueous ammonia solution generated in solution 5‘-S-tert-butylsulfenyl-l-cysteinyl functionalized oligonucleotides. Functionalized peptides and oligonucleotides were used without purification in native ligation conjugation reactions in aqueous/organic solution using tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to remove the tert-butylsulfenyl group in situ and thiophenol as a conjugation enhancer. A range of peptide−oligonucleotide conjugates were prepared by this route and purified by reversed-phase HPLC.",
    "In the course of the random screening of a pool of CIBA chemicals, the two pyrazolopyrimidines 1 and 2 have been identified as fairly potent inhibitors of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase. Using a pharmacophore model for ATP-competitive inhibitors interacting with the active site of the EGF-R protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), the class of the pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines was then optimized in an interactive process leading to a series of 4-(phenylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines as highly potent inhibitors of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase. The most potent compounds 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 22, 26, 28, and 30 of this series inhibited the EGF-R PTK with IC50 values below 10 nM. High selectivity toward a panel of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (c-Src, v-Abl and serine/threonine kinases (PKC α, CDK1) was observed. In cells, EGF-stimulated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by compounds 13, 15, 19, 22, and 23 at IC50 values below 50 nM, whereas PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected by concentrations up to 10 μM, thus indicating high selectivity for the inhibition of the ligand-activated EGF-R signal transduction pathway. Compounds 15 and 19 inhibited proliferation of the EGF-dependent MK cell line with IC50 values below 0.5 μM. In addition, two compounds, 9 and 11, showing satisfactory oral bioavailability in mice after oral administration, exhibited good invivo efficacy at doses of 12.5 and 50 mg/kg in a nude mouse tumor model using xenografts of the EGF-R overexpressing A431 cell line. From SAR studies, a binding mode for 4-(phenylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines, especially for compound 15, at the ATP-binding site of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase is proposed. 4-(Phenylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines represent a new class of highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors which preferentially inhibit the EGF-mediated signal transduction pathway and have the potential for further evaluation as anticancer agents.",
    "It has been found that sulfur dioxide solubility in organic solvents can be well-correlated by Lewis basicity numbers. Mixtures of sulfur dioxide and solvent (N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), N,N‘-(dimethylpropylene)urea (DMPU) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)) have been prepared in a 1:1 mole ratio at low temperatures. The melting points of the mixtures are measured, and the mixtures have been analyzed by infrared, ultraviolet−visible, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The solubility of sulfur dioxide has been measured in NMP and DMPU at 25 °C. At sulfur dioxide concentrations of 0.2−0.6 kPa, the solubility is determined using a continuous stirred tank reactor. The absorption of sulfur dioxide proved to be completely reversible. A model where physical and chemical interactions are incorporated showed good correlation with the experimental results.",
    "Transient experiments performed over synthesized and commercial V2O5−WO3/TiO2 catalysts during catalyst conditioning and during step changes of the operating variables (SO2 inlet concentration and temperature) show that conditioning of the catalyst is required to attain significant and reproducible steady-state data in both the reduction of NOx and the oxidation of SO2 . The response time of conditioning for NOx reduction is of a few hours and that for SO2 oxidation is of several hours. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy temperature programmed decomposition, and thermogravimetric measurements showed that catalyst conditioning is associated with a slow process of buildup of sulfates: the different characteristic conditioning times observed in the reduction of NOx and in the oxidation of SO2 suggest that the buildup of sulfates occurs first at the vanadyl sites and later on at the exposed titania surface. Formation of sulfates at or near the vanadyl sites increases the reactivity in the de-NOx reaction, possibly due to the increase in the Brønsted and Lewis acidity of the catalyst, whereas the titania surface acts as SO3 acceptor and affects the outlet SO3 concentration during catalyst conditioning for the SO2 oxidation reaction. The response time to step changes in SO2 concentration and temperature is of a few hours in the case of SO2 oxidation and much shorter in the case of NOx reduction. The different time responses associated with conditioning and with step changes in the settings of the operating variables have been rationalized in terms of the different extent of perturbation of the sulfate coverage experienced by the catalyst.",
    "Sixteen fish species and 31 invertebrate species were identified on Horizon Guyot and five other bathyal seamounts in the central North Pacific Ocean from trawl and baited-trap collections augmented with video camera recordings. The seamount fauna shows zoogeographic affinities with fauna of the Indo-West Pacific as does the marine shore fauna of central Pacific Islands."

    "The soil disturbance produced by a range of trenchless drainage tines, working under different soil conditions, is described and the effect of the different types of disturbance on subsequent drainage system performance considered. Few problems are likely to arise with trenchless tines working above critical depth. Below critical depth, impeding layers may develop alongside the pipe, reducing drainage efficiency in groundwater control situations, and lack of crack development above the pipe may impede water flow in top-water problem areas. Soil conditions most susceptible to damage are highlighted and methods suggested for avoiding, alleviating and minimizing potential problems. The study suggests trenchless drainage installation techniques can be used with confidence over a wide range of soil conditions, providing care is taken and in some cases, modifications made to the technique.",
    "The cost functions of water conveyance through lined open canals and underground pipelines have been developed. The cost of water conveyance through open lined canals and underground pipes can be reduced by using these methods in combination. A simple mathematical model has been developed to determine the breakeven point for underground pipelines and open canals which considers the costs of works, materials and a derived relationship between the embankment height and the cost of construction. It was concluded that in the conditions of Northern Nigeria, underground pipelines would be more economical than open lined canals when the embankment heights exceeded certain values. The results of the calculations are presented graphically by way of example.",
    "One option for reducing soil surface compaction resulting from the passage of lightly loaded vehicles is to reduce the inflation pressure of conventional tyres below the minimum currently recommended by tyre manufacturers. This paper describes an investigation of one potential problem, collapse of a tyre when subjected to large side forces, which might result from this approach.",
    "An automated measuring system was developed for monitoring the concentration of individual chemical ions in nutrient film solutions. This used ion-selective electrodes to measure pH, nitrate, potassium, calcium, sodium and chloride in solutions used for growing greenhouse tomatoes. The use of frequent and regular calibrations with two solutions which encompassed the concentrations existing in the nutrient solution enabled both short and long term drift of the electrodes to be accommodated, and electrode life to be extended. The accuracy of pH measurement was shown to be \u00b1 0\u00b74 pH units, while the concentrations of nitrate and potassium could be obtained with uncertainties of \u00b1 10 and \u00b1 20% respectively. The repeatability of measurements made on the same samples were within 10 p.p.m. or 0\u00b705 pH units, with the exception of a value of 27 p.p.m. obtained with calcium. The life of the glass and solid state electrodes used for pH, sodium and chloride exceeded 2 years, but that of the p.v.c. electrodes used for nitrate, potassium and calcium, were typically 4, 2 and less than one month, respectively.",
    "Experiments to investigate how blocking in cage wheels occurs showed three possible mechanisms. It was found that these mechanisms were strong functions of lug slip and lug spacing (the angular spacing between two consecutive lugs), in Bangkok clay soil at 49% (d.b.) moisture content. The blocking process observed at 100% slip was found to be the most likely mechanism by which cage wheels block in wet soil in practice.",
    "Variations in the performance characteristics of propeller fans of a range of sizes and from different manufacturers have been established. Desirable and undesirable features of performance are highlighted. Significant differences in performance have been found even between nominally similar fans. Fans of the same nominal diameter but of different manufacture vary widely in their efficiency and torque. It is concluded that it is not adequate to select a fan either solely on the basis of its nominal diameter or according to manufacturer. The merits of each fan should be evaluated in the proposed application to obtain the best overall performance.",
    "The oil-point is identified as a bulk property of rapeseeds under compression. It is the stage at which compression of the bed has sufficiently squeezed the individual seeds for oil to be forced from their interior to their surfaces. A 10 mm thick bed of rapeseeds was compressed and a method of measuring the oil-point bed strain and pressure is described. Experimental results are given along with correlations which interrelate bed strain (0\u00b7362\u20130\u00b7486), pressure (5\u00b772\u20139\u00b768 MPa), rate of deformation (5\u201319\u00b75 mm/min) and seed moisture content (0\u201312\u00b74% wet basis). Influence of seed moisture content on bed strain and pressure was much stronger than that of the rate of deformation.",
    "The dependence of methylene group deformational coordinates upon the puckering amplitude q has been analyzed for a set of ab initio geometries of the four-membered ring (CH2)3X. For small values of the puckering amplitude, the rocking and twisting deformational coordinates are proportional to q, whereas for q > 0.3 Å, the inclusion of a cubic term in q is necessary in order to describe the dependence of those deformational coordinates with the puckering amplitude. The wagging deformational coordinate shows a linear correlation with the square of q, although the effect is so weak that, for small variations in q, the wagging coordinate can be considered constant",
    "The solution and solid state structures of single stereoisomers of α-adducts of diethyl(1-cyclohexenyl)methyl-phosphonate and three aldehydes were determined by NMR spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction. In both phases, the molecules exist in virtually the same conformation, involving gauche orientation of the PO3Et2 and the 2-hydroxy groups, and trans orientation of the former group and the R group of the aldehyde molecule. In the crystal, this conformation is retained in spite of the fact that PO⋯HO hydrogen bonding occurs inter- and not intramolecularly",

Vicinal coupling constants of stereochemical significance were obtained in deuterated solvent using NMR techniques. Comparison with values calculated for lisinopril using potential energy calculations and NMR show that lisinopril exists in preferred optimum conformation in solution",

    "Dark-colored material (cryoconite) covering Himalayan glaciers has been reported to greatly accelerate glacier-melting by reducing surface albedo. Structure, formation, and the darkening process of the cryoconite on a Himalayan glacier were analyzed. The cryoconite was revealed to be a stromatolite-like algal mat, a product of microbial activity on the glacier. The granular algal mat contains filamentous blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and bacteria, and grows on the ice by trapping mineral and organic particles. This structure seems to enable high algal production in nutrient poor glacial meltwater by gathering and keeping nutrient rich particles inside. The dark coloration of the mats promotes melt-hole formation on the ice (cryoconite holes), providing a semistagnant aquatic habitat for various algae and animals in the glacier. Optical and chemical analyses of the cryoconite strongly suggests that their high light- absorbency (dark coloration) is mainly due to dark-colored humic substances, residues from bacterial decomposition of the algal products and other organic matter. Our results strongly suggest that biological activity on the glacier substantially affects the albedo of the glacier surface. The structure of the algal mat seems to be important in the glacier ecosystem and biological process affecting glacier albedo",
    "Between October 1993 and May 1998 we measured snow depth (cm), density (g cm−3), and resistance (kg × cm) adjacent to 53 Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) and 134 muskox (Ovibos moschatus) feeding craters on Banks Island in the Canadian High Arctic. Measurements were taken in early (26 October-18 November), mid- (12 February–1 March), and late-winter (20 April–4 May). Concurrently, we recorded snow depth, density, and resistance along fixed transects in the four habitats used by foraging caribou and muskoxen. Caribou craters were found predominantly (94%) in upland habitats; upland barren (UB), hummock tundra (HT), and stony barren (SB). Caribou abandoned craters in the more rolling UB and HT when snow was shallower, less dense, and less resistant than average snow conditions in these habitats; in most cases the differences were significant (P < 0.01). In SB, the habitat with the shallowest snow, caribou cratered through snow conditions similar to the average found in this habitat. During winter 1994–95, when snow depth, density, and resistance was greatest, we located caribou craters only in SB. Muskox craters were found almost exclusively (96%) in wet sedge meadows (WSM); the habitat with deepest snow. Muskoxen abandoned crater sites when snow depth, density, and resistance was less (P < 0.01) than average conditions in WSM, regardless of animal density. Muskoxen in low density areas were faced with deeper snow, particularly in late- winter, and they abandoned crater sites when snow depth was greater (P < 0.004) than muskoxen in high density areas. During winter 1994–95, muskox cratered through deeper, denser, and more resistant snow than during winter 1997–98 when snow conditions were the least severe of the study. We discuss our results in relation to the population dynamics of Peary caribou and muskoxen on Banks Island.",
    "Dramatic retreat of ice shelves in Antarctica in recent years, linked to climatic warming, is well documented. In contrast, the ice shelves of the Russian Arctic remain largely unstudied. A time-series analysis of the largest ice shelf in the Russian High Arctic, the Matusevich Ice Shelf, Severnaya Zemlya, was undertaken for the period 1931 to 1994 using georeferenced Landsat satellite imagery and published maps. The positions of three major ice margins in 1931, 1955, 1962, 1973, 1985, 1988, and 1994 are compared. The floating margin of the ice shelf underwent at least two cycles of retreat followed by periods of advance between 1931 and 1994. These periodic calving events produce tabular icebergs up to several kilometers in length. This process is typical of floating ice shelves in Antarctica and Greenland, whereas grounded ice margins in, for example, Svalbard, produce smaller icebergs much more frequently. There is little evidence that these calving events are related to climate change.Landsat imagery is also used to track the movement of 50 icebergs identified in 1985 imagery of Matusevich Fjord. Iceberg release from the fjord between 1985 and 1994 was extremely slow, with 48 of the icebergs observed in 1985 still trapped in the fjord in 1994. The icebergs from Matusevich Ice Shelf remain in the fjord for many years, probably due to either grounding on submarine moraines or trapping by shore-fast sea ice. Much of the sediment load of the trapped icebergs may be melted out and deposited beneath the sea-ice cover of Matusevich Fjord, and little iceberg-rafted debris of heterogeneous grain size will be transported to the Laptev Sea.",
    "We here describe glacial geomorphology that sheds light on ice-dynamic conditions during the Noble Inlet advance, a glacial event involving northward ice flow across Hudson Strait and large-magnitude meltwater drainage across Meta Incognita Peninsula at around 8.9 to 8.4 14C kyr BR Through airphoto interpretation and field inspection of key sites we mapped the glacial geomorphology of interior Meta Incognita Peninsula, the postulated terminal zone for northward expansion of ice from Quebec-Labrador during the Noble Inlet advance. A 170-km-long zone of glaciofluvial canyons, washing zones and boulder deltas was traced from Shaftesbury Inlet to Henderson Inlet. This zone reflects initial drainage across Meta Incognita Peninsula at >520 m elevation, followed by ice marginal drainage at progressively lower levels along the southern slope of the peninsula. The ice marginal outline required to explain the glaciofluvial zone is compatible with northward-trending striae previously reported from the southern coast of Meta Incognita Peninsula. A very large flux of meltwater across Meta Incognita Peninsula probably occurred because eastward supraglacial drainage on ice in Hudson Strait was temporarily impeded and steered northward by a raised ice surface level in outer Hudson Strait, induced by an enhanced outflow of ice from Ungava Bay.",
    "AbstractWe used fossil beetles recovered from three peatlands of the James Bay area (Radisson, northern Quebec, Canada), and the mutual climatic range (MCR) method, to produce a quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures during the last 5000 yr. Our main objective was to test the hypothesis that a significant climatic cooling episode occurred during the late Holocene epoch, leading to the opening up of the boreal forest, and to the progressive replacement of black spruce (Picea mariana) forests by jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands. Beetle assemblages in the Radisson area were very stable during the late Holocene epoch. We used a total of 22 beetle species to conduct the MCR analyses. Reconstructed mean July temperatures ranged from 14.5 to 17.5°C, which is close to the present-day (A.D. 1977–1996) temperature range found in the Radisson area. The general stability of beetle assemblages, and the MCR analyses, suggest that there was no major change in July temperatures during the last 5000 yr in the Radisson area. This study provides no evidence that the progressive replacement of black spruce forests by jack pine stands in the Radisson area during the last 2700 yr can be explained by a longterm climatic cooling episode affecting the postfire regeneration potential of trees. Consequently, an alternative hypothesis (more frequent fires favoring jack pine) should be seriously considered to explain the late Holocene changes in the forest environment of the Radisson area.",
    "AbstractNumerous cold-induced changes in physiology limit the capacity of northern conifers to photosynthesize during winter. Studies of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) have shown that rates of field photosynthesis (Pfield) and laboratory measurements of photosynthetic capacity (Pmax) generally parallel seasonal ambient temperature trends; carbon exchange decreases in the fall, remains negative or close to zero for much of the winter, and increases in the spring. However, increases in Pfield, Pmax, and foliar carbohydrate concentrations can occur during winter thaws. Thaw-induced increases in photosynthesis are probably not the result of increased stomatal conductance, but may result from other changes in physiology associated with thaw-induced improvements in water relations. In addition to increased photosynthesis, red spruce also decrease in cold hardiness during thaws. The cooccurrence of thaw-induced changes in photosynthesis and cold hardiness raises questions regarding their adaptive significance, particularly in the context of potential climate change. Red spruce may face a tradeoff between potentially beneficial increases in carbon capture and potentially detrimental reductions in cold tolerance. The physiological consequence(s) of this tradeoff may depend on the number and duration of thaws, as well as ambient temperature trends following thaw. Pollution-induced reductions in cold tolerance, and the low genetic variability of red spruce, may also influence the net outcome of thaw-induced changes in physiology.",
    "AbstractLow temperatures and high sunlight, factors that are characteristic of high elevations, may lead to the low-temperature photoinhibition of photosynthesis (LTP). Exposure and photosynthetic responses to low temperature and high sunlight were compared among current-year seedlings of the conifers Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii, and the snowbank perennials Caltha leptosepala and Erythronium grandiflorum, in the alpine treeline ecotone. The ratio of silhouette (sunlit) to total leaf area of whole plants was greatest in A. lasiocarpa (0.33), 25% lower in P. engelmannii (0.25), and at least 36% lower in the snowbank perennials than for A. lasiocarpa. This indicated less structural avoidance of high sunlight in the conifer seedlings, particularly A. lasiocarpa. CO2 assimilation (Asat) in A. lasiocarpa was reduced 40% due to frosts, high sunlight (22%), and their combination (90%). Asat was much less affected by frosts and high sunlight in P. engelmannii and especially the perennials. Following frost and high sunlight exposure, diurnal reductions in maximum photosynthetic efficiency, indicated by the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio Fv/Fm, corresponded to species differences in Asat. A substantially greater degree of slowly-reversible, or irreversible LTP (44% reduction in predawn Fv/Fm) occurred in the microclimate above snow for A. lasiocarpa compared to the other species. It appears that a higher resistance to LTP in the perennials may contribute to their greater occurrence in microsites with lower temperatures and higher sunlight compared to the conifer seedlings.",
    "AbstractPinus albicaulis (whitebark pine) is an important tree species in subalpine forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. Populations have been declining at unprecedented rates due to the introduction of an exotic pathogen and fire suppression. We initiated this study to evaluate historical trends in Pinus albicaulis abundance along with associated subalpine conifers within a small biogeographically disjunct mountain range. The central objective was to estimate historic trends in subalpine forest composition and structure at the species and community scales. Reconstruction of forest stands reveals an 85% increase in tree volume among all species since the 1870s. Pinus albicaulis has historically dominated most stands associated with Abies bifolia (subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce) but dominance has shifted to these late-seral species for most of the study area since the early 1900s. We estimate, that since 1753, nearly 50% of the study area has shifted to later successional stages while only 3% has receded to earlier stages. We discuss the implications for Pinus albicaulis and suggest that careful reintroduction of fire can aid in the maintenance of ecological integrity at the community and landscape scales.",
    "In the forest-alpine ecotone at Stillberg (Dischmatal/Switzerland) the morphology of humus forms and the spatial variability of organic layer properties were investigated. At northeast-exposed gully sites mulls with high acidity in the A-horizon occur. They were classified after the Canadian classification of humus forms as Rhizomulls. Mors occur on ridges and on their east- and north-exposed aspects. They can be differentiated by the ratio between the thickness of the F-horizon and the combined thickness of the F- and H-horizon. The relative thickness of the F-horizon increases significantly in the order: east aspects < ridges < north aspect. The humus forms of the east aspects and the ridges were classified as Humimors and those of the north aspects as Hemimors. The Canadian classification was suitable to describe the properties of the horizons and to classify the humus forms. The results of a grid sampling at the study sites and the computation of nonergodic correlograms show that the spatial variability of organic-layer thickness, bulk density, and moisture is high (CV around 50%), with a pronounced small-scale heterogeneity (range usually below 2 m and more than 50% variability occurs within 0.3 m). Only 33% of the variance of organic-layer thickness were explained by site and vegetation structure, but in spite of the low percentage both proved to be a significant factor. In the forest-alpine tundra ecotone about 30 to 35 soil samples per site are needed for a reliable estimation of the mean of the organic-layer thickness.",
    "AbstractIn the antarctic summer of 1996, permafrost-affected cold soils close to the Australian Casey Station in the Windmill Islands region (Wilkes Land) were investigated to determine in what way the thermal and nutrient regimes in the antarctic soils are related to microbial biomass and vegetation patterns. The soils are characterized by a high content of coarse mineral particles and total organic carbon (TOC) and a low C/N ratio (mean 11). Despite the low pH values (mean 4.0) the soils are rich in nutrients due to an input from seabirds (existing or abandoned nesting sites) and an eolian distribution of fine-grained soil material in the landscape. Vegetation influences TOC storage and the cation exchange capacity in the uppermost soil horizons, whereas total N and most nutrient levels are not affected by the vegetation, but by seabird droppings. The present nutrient level does not affect plant adaptation, because the K, Mg, and P contents are often extraordinarily high. This suggests that nutrient supply is not a limiting factor, whereas microclimate effects, such as moisture availability and ground-level wind speed, have a primary influence on plant growth. Soil-surface temperature measurements indicate a strong variability in microclimate due to small-scale variations in geomorphological surface features. Bacteria are found in all soil horizons, but not algae and yeast. Soil microbial counts are weakly correlated to the C/N ratios and soil surface temperatures. High TOC and clay contents probably improve the soil water-holding capacity and TOC contributes to the microbial food supply. The investigated microbial parameters are weakly correlated to the present vegetation carpet, the lowest counts are found in the soils with scattered or no vegetation cover.",

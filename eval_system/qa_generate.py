Temporal Variability in Heterotrophic Carbon Dioxide Emissions From A Drained Tropical Peatland in Uganda\n==============\n\nJenny Farmer ,Charlie Langan ,Jo U. Smith\n\n# Abstract\n\nOur study measured heterotrophic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>) emissions in a drained peatland under potato cultivation in south-western Uganda. Soil carbon losses have not previously been reported for this land use, and our study set out to capture the range and temporal variation in emissions, as well as investigate relationships with key environmental variables. Soil chamber-based emission measurements were taken over five days at four points in time over the year to capture daily and monthly variability, including day and night sampling to capture any diurnal variations in temperatures and soil flux. Differences in soil microtopography from mounding of soils for potato beds and drainage trenches had a significant effect on the rate of soil flux. Diurnal sampling showed no significant difference in emissions or soil temperatures in the raised potato beds between day and night. More significant effects on soil flux from environmental drivers, such as water table depth, were observed between months, rather than hours and days. There were significant differences in the relationships between environmental variables and soil flux, depending on if soils had been recently disturbed or not. Area-weighted emissions based on microtopography gave a mean annual emissions factor of 98.79 ± 1.7 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> y<sup>-1<\/sup> (± standard error) from this peatland use.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nGlobally, peatlands cover approximately 420 million ha, equivalent to 2.8% of the world land area. Of this area, approximately 44-170 million ha are found in the tropics, with an estimated tropical peatland carbon (C) pool of 81.7-91.9 Gt C. The C rich soils in peatlands are formed from long-term accumulation of dead plant material, preserved under anaerobic conditions due to high water table levels. Land use change in peatlands results in significant C losses to the atmosphere, principally due to drainage leading to microbial decomposition of the soil C, aquatic export of dissolved and particulate organic C, and methane emissions from drainage channels. Of the total area of tropical peatlands, it is estimated that approximately 24.2 Mha are degraded, with a loss of 1.48 Gt CO<sub>2<\/sub> per year.\n\nWhile the Congo Basin in central Africa has the most extensive peatland complex on the continent [and the most extensive in the tropics], neighbouring Uganda is the largest contributor to emissions from degrading peat in Africa, where at least 0.5 Mha of Uganda’s estimated 1.3 Mha of peatland has been degraded, resulting in CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions of up to 20 Mt yr<sup>-1<\/sup>. However, there is limited research into the use of peat soils in Uganda, and the impacts of peatland degradation on soil C and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics.\n\nAcross Uganda wetland types vary, and can be found fringing lakes, in lowland plains and in valley bottoms. Vegetation found in these wetlands are diverse and include grassland, *Cyperus papyrus*, woodlands, and palms, with plants either anchored into the soil or floating on the water’s surface. These wetland areas are where Uganda’s peat soils are found. While the extent of peat soils across the country is still to be fully documented, they are often found underpinning papyrus-dominated wetland areas, in particular in the SW of the country. The valley bottom wetlands of the Kigezi highlands close to the border with Rwanda have some of the deepest reported peat deposits of all of Uganda, but the most widespread wetland drainage and land use change occurs here as well. Wetland conversion is largely due to agricultural drivers, with cultivation of potatoes on these peat soils estimated to provide income of US$ 3,000 ± 1,000 ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> to smallholder farmers.\n\nWhile the key environmental drivers affecting GHG emissions from soils have been documented in many studies and indicate strong relationships between temperature, water table depth (WTD) and soil respiration flux, there is limited understanding of these relationships for the diversity of conditions found across tropical peatlands. It is important to highlight the need to differentiate the CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions from heterotrophic respiration during microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (R<sub>h<\/sub>) and the emissions from roots and autotrophs which is not a result of soil carbon loss, The majority of tropical peatland emissions research has been conducted in SE Asia, and to a lesser extent in the Amazon basin, but there are considerable gaps when it comes to understanding the range and biogeochemistry of C losses experienced by these drained peatlands under the diversity of land use changes and wetland conditions occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. At an ecosystem level the work of Saunders et al. identified reductions in ecosystem C due to agricultural conversion in wetlands in Uganda based on measurements of photosynthetic CO<sub>2<\/sub> assimilation, but how much soils contribute to overall carbon loss from these systems is unknown.\n\nFor these reasons, this study set out to understand the biogeochemistry and rates of C losses from peat soils under land use change, through measurement of heterotrophic CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes from a potato cultivated peatland in a deep peat wetland system in SW Uganda. The key objectives of this were to quantify the potential range of soil CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes associated with this land use change on this soil, identify if there is temporal variability in these CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes, and identify any relationships between soil CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes and key environmental variables.\n\n# 2 Methods\n\nThis study was implemented in the catchment of the Ruhuma wetland system in Muko Sub-county, Kabale District, in the Kigezi Highlands of south western Uganda (-1.208752° latitude, 29.830968° longitude, approximately 1,900 m above sea level). The landscape comprises of steep mineral soil hillsides which slope into a minerotrophic wetland valley bottom. The entire landscape is a mosaic of small, privately cultivated plots, with those in the wetland managed under farmer cooperatives, and individual plots distributed between farmers, most of whom manage multiple plots.\n\nThe Ruhuma wetland system is part of a network of peat dominated, valley bottom wetlands in the area, located 35 km SW of Kabale town, where the river Ruhuma flows north out of Lake Bunyonyi. The wetland covers approximately 5.47 km<sup>2<\/sup>, at an altitude of 1,930 m above sea level. Wetland edge cultivation began in the 1980s and by the late 1990s the majority of the wetland was drained and converted for cultivation (personal communication). Peat depths in this wetland are significant, with measurements in the site indicating depths of over 10 m (personal data), and other studies measuring peat depths of over 20 m in neighbouring wetlands. The sapric peat soils found in this wetland are highly organic, with average organic matter contents measured at 87.22 ± 3.9% [± SD, n=198] and bulk densities averaging 0.125 ± 0.04 g cm<sup>3<\/sup> [± SD, n=835].\n\nIn order to determine the range and temporal variability in fluxes from peat soils under potato cultivation we measured CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions at daily, weekly and monthly timesteps. To capture the weekly and monthly variability, we conducted four sets of repeated 5-day morning (between 9.00 and 11.00) and afternoon (between 15.00 and 17.00) measurements on thirty randomly located paired collars (15 on raised beds and 15 on adjacent trenches) within a potato field. In addition to this, on the 4<sup>th<\/sup> day of each sampling period we added sampling at 18.00, 21.00 and 24.00, and 5.00 and 12.00 the following day, with the intention of capturing diurnal variability in temperatures and emissions. In order to determine the relationships between soil CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes and key environmental variables, soil CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions, soil and air temperatures, WTD were all recorded *in situ* from each collar for every measurement. Measurements were all conducted from within the same farmer’s field in an area under management by the Rurigita Farmer’s Cooperative of the Ruhuma wetland.\n\nWhen preparing the experimental design we were limited by the lack of available land use information, in particular around how the soils were used over the year. We targeted our sampling campaigns as best as possible towards capturing the potential difference in environmental and management conditions that the soils would experience over the year. Measurements were taken at the end of the rainy season in May 2014 when wetland soils were dug in preparation for planting of potatoes, in the dry season in August 2014 during the potato growing season, in the rainy season in November 2014 after the harvest at the start of the fallow period, and in February 2015 during the dry season and fallow period prior to the next season of planting. Farmers digging of the potato beds in May involved the clearing of fallow weeds into the old trenches between old, raised beds, and then piling the soil from the previous year’s beds into these trenches. Once the old bed had been transferred into the old trench, further digging down into fresher peat brought up previously unexposed soil which was piled on top of the new beds. After approximately 48 hours these new beds were planted with rows of potatoes. Potatoes grew for approximately 3.5 months, when they were harvested for market with the onset of the new rainy season in September. After harvesting, beds were left fallow until the following June, when the cycle of mining and mounding fresh peat to create new beds was repeated.\n\nCollars made from PVC piping 10 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height were fully inserted into the soil. Care was taken to place collars away from any plants and they were checked on removal at the end of each sampling period to ensure no plant roots were present. These collars remained *in situ* for each 5-day set of samples and were then removed and randomly placed for the next month’s sampling. Soil CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions were sampled using a PP Systems EGM-4 with a SRC-1 Soil Respiration Chamber placed onto the collars. Chamber measurements were set to run for up to 120 seconds. The WTD was recorded using a tape-measure and pre-prepared dip-well near to each pair of collars, and soil and air temperature were recorded during each flux measurement using digital thermometers with a 0.1°C resolution.\n\nAll data analysis was conducted in R Studio v 1.4.1106 using R v 4.0.4. A linear function was applied to the concentrations of CO<sub>2<\/sub> recorded for each measurement and data was then converted into flux based on the following equation:\n\n$$\n{R}_h=(S\\times (\\frac{P}{1000})\\times (\\frac{273}{273+T})\\times (\\frac{40.01}{22.41})\\times (\\frac{V}{A}))\/1000\\times 3600 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere *R*<sub>h<\/sub> was the rate of efflux (g m<sup>-2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup>), *S* was the slope of the concentration increase during the measurement (ppm s<sup>-1<\/sup>), *P* was the pressure in the chamber (mBar, recorded by the EGM), *T* was the soil temperature (°C), *V* was the chamber volume (0.001171 m<sup>3<\/sup>), and *A* was the collar area (0.0078 m<sup>2<\/sup>). The ratio $\\frac{40.01}{22.41}$ accounts for the area occupied by one kg mol of CO<sub>2<\/sub> at standard temperature and pressure. Division by 1,000 and multiplication by 3,600 converts kg to g and seconds to hours.\n\nMean results are presented with either standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), as noted in the results. T-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare results, along with Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Linear models were developed based on log transformed R<sub>h<\/sub>. We explored a series of linear models for R<sub>h<\/sub> and WTD, soil temperature and soil management (raised beds, trenches and recent disturbance). Regression models were further improved with the log transformation of the R<sub>h<\/sub>.\n\n# 3 Results\n\nOver 1,300 soil flux measurements were taken as part of this study. We observed a significant difference in the rate of soil flux from the raised beds (referred to as raised beds, n=648), compared to the narrow drainage trenches between them (referred to as trenches, n=653, t-test, p<0.005, **Table 1**), and as such all results are split based on this micro-topographical difference. Across all samples, the mean heterotrophic respiration (R<sub>h<\/sub>) emissions of CO<sub>2<\/sub> from the raised beds was 1.39 ± 0.6 g m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> (± SD) and from trenches was 0.22 ± 0.1 g m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup>.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table 1: Range in day time and night time results for soil and air temperatures and flux, from raised beds and trenches.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Diurnal (n measurements) & Soil temperature (°C, mean ± SD, min., max.) & Air temperature (°C, mean ± SD, min., max.) & R<sub>h<\/sub> (g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup>, mean ± SD, min., max.) \\\\\n \\midrule\n Raised beds & Day time (575) & 19.2 ± 1.1, 16.4, 23.7 & 22.7 ± 4.1, 14.0, 34.0 & 1.381 ± 0.6, 0.546, 3.971 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Night time (73) & 19.6 ± 1.1, 17.3, 22.0 & 12.9 ± 1.9, 10.0, 17.0 & 1.529 ± 0.6, 0.552, 3.307 \\\\\n \\hline\n Trenches & Day time (587) & 18.4 ± 0.8, 16.2, 20.7 & 22.8 ± 4.1, 14.0, 32.0 & 0.228 ± 0.1, 0.019, 0.856 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Night time (66) & 18.8 ± 0.5, 17.6, 20.0 & 13.0 ± 1.9, 10.0, 17.0 & 0.187 ± 0.1, 0.035, 0.541 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T1}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n## 3.1 Range in Soil Respiration Fluxes and Environmental Variables\n\nAcross all measurements, the minimum air temperature recorded was 10 °C, and the maximum was 34 °C. Day time air temperatures (taken in day light hours; i.e. between 7.00 and 19.00) ranged between a minimum of 14 °C to a maximum of 34 °C, compared to night time measurements which were limited to 10-17 °C. Across all measurements the minimum soil temperature was 16.2 °C and the maximum 23.7 °C. Soil temperatures did not show such a change between day to night conditions, with almost identical mean temperatures reported for daytime and night-time results per micro-topographical class (**Table 1**). Mean R<sub>h<\/sub> was higher in the night than in the day from the raised beds, whereas from the trenches it was lower. Measured WTDs varied between 21 cm and 81 cm below the soil surface of the raised beds, and between 2 cm above and 52 cm below the soil surface of the trenches.\n\n## 3.2 Temporal Variability\n\n### 3.2.1 Daily\n\nAcross the entire dataset, separated for raised beds and trenches, we found that there was no significant difference in the R<sub>h<\/sub> measured from the raised beds between the sampling times of day (ANOVA, p=0.27, **Figure 1**). In the trenches a significant difference in R<sub>h<\/sub> was found between morning and midnight measurements and the morning and measurements taken in the 15.00 to 17.00 time period (ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD, p<0.005). Soil temperature on the raised beds and in the trenches was significantly different between the measurements earlier in the day (the morning and early afternoon measurements from 5.00 – 14.00) compared with the higher later afternoon and night-time measurements (15.00 – 1.00), potentially due to a lag time from daytime sun (p<0.001).\n\nAir temperature showed a significant reduction in temperature over the night-time sampling points (p<0.001).\n\n### 3.2.2 Day to Day\n\nUsing the regularly sampled morning and afternoon datasets, there was a significant difference between the means of some results when compared between the 5 days of sampling, with data grouped based on microtopography, month, and time of day that measurements were taken (ANOVA, with significance determined based on p value <0.05, using the regular morning and afternoon measurements, **Table 2**). Soil and air temperature were the most frequently different variables between days. The WTD only varied significantly between days in November and February. There were no significant differences in the day-to-day R<sub>h<\/sub> measurements on raised beds, and only in the trenches in November and February, corresponding to the period of variation in the WTD.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table 2: Occasions when there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in flux results across the 5 day measurement period per month, split for raised beds and trenches, and split into morning and afternoon measurements.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Month & Number of measurement days & AM soil temperature & PM soil temperature & AM air temperature & PM air temperature & AM water table depth & PM water table depth & AM R<sub>h<\/sub> measurements & PM R<sub>h<\/sub> measurements \\\\\n \\midrule\n Raised beds & May 2014 & 5 & * & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & August 2014 & 5 & & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & November 2014 & 5 & * & * & * & * & * & * & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & February 2015 & 5 (AM), 3 (PM) & * & * & & * & * & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n Trenches & May 2014 & 5 & * & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & August 2014 & 5 & & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & November 2014 & 5 & * & * & * & * & * & & * & * \\\\\n \\hline\n & February 2015 & 5 (AM), 3 (PM) & * & * & & * & * & * & * & \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T2}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n### 3.2.3 Month to Month\n\nMeasured environmental variables and R<sub>h<\/sub> varied significantly over the year between sampling occasions (p<0.05),; this allowed us to examine the difference between results from raised beds and the trenches using the regularly sampled morning and afternoon data (**Tables 3**, **4**). Comparison between the four months found there were significant differences between most variables measured. In all months except November-May and November-August the WTD was significantly different between months in the raised beds, and across all months there was a significant difference between months in the WTD in the trenches. Soil temperatures were higher on the raised beds than trenches, and were significantly different between almost all months. Average daytime air temperature each month was between 20 and 25 °C, and varied significantly between almost all months. Heterotrophic respiration was higher from the raised beds than trenches and varied significantly between most months.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table 3: The average results and standard deviation from all measurements each month, separated into results from raised beds and trenches.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Month & Water table depth (cm, ± SD) & Soil temperature (°C, ± SD) & Air temperature (°C, ± SD) & R<sub>h<\/sub> (g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup>, ± SD) \\\\\n \\midrule\n \\multirow{4}{*}{Raised beds} & May 2014 & -65.4 ± 4.6 & 19.7 ± 1.1 & 24.6 ± 2.7 & 1.603 ± 0.607 \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & August 2014 & -67.8 ± 4.9 & 19.1 ± 0.7 & 23.3 ± 3.5 & 1.049 ± 0.269 \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November 2014 & -65.7 ± 4.6 & 19.7 ± 1.1 & 20.2 ± 4.1 & 1.842 ± 0.675 \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & February 2015 & -48.4 ± 4.9 & 18.0 ± 0.9 & 23.4 ± 4.3 & 0.952 ± 0.201 \\\\\n \\hline\n \\multirow{4}{*}{Trenches} & May 2014 & -19.0 ± 3.0 & 18.3 ± 0.8 & 24.6 ± 2.7 & 0.22 ± 0.08 \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & August 2014 & -28.4 ± 3.3 & 18.6 ± 0.6 & 23.3 ± 3.5 & 0.28 ± 0.13 \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November 2014 & -11.3 ± 4.2 & 18.6 ± 0.7 & 20.2 ± 4.1 & 0.24 ± 0.12 \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & February 2015 & -9.8 ± 4.4 & 17.8 ± 0.7 & 23.4 ± 4.3 & 0.16 ± 0.09 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T3}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table 4: Significant differences (p<0.05) in measurements between months based on Tukeys HSD at 95% confidence interval.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Month & Water table depth & Soil temperature & Air temperature & R<sub>h<\/sub> \\\\\n \\midrule\n \\multirow{6}{*}{Raised beds} & May-February & * & * & * & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & August-February & * & * & & \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November-February & * & * & * & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & August-May & * & * & * & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November-May & & & * & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November-August & & * & * & * \\\\\n \\hline\n \\multirow{6}{*}{Trenches} & May-February & * & * & & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & August-February & * & * & & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November-February & * & * & * & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & August-May & * & * & * & * \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November-May & * & * & * & \\\\\n \\cline{2-6} \n \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & November-August & * & & * & \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T4}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n## 3.3 Relationship With Variables\n\nWe observed an effect of soil disturbance on the R<sub>h<\/sub> and its relationship with environmental variables. Disturbance was due to digging of the peat for preparation of the raised beds (in May 2014), and from the potato harvest prior to flux sampling in November. At the undisturbed sampling times we saw a significant relationship between the WTD and R<sub>h<\/sub> (p<0.001, adjusted r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.77) and a strong relationship between the soil temperature and R<sub>h<\/sub> although with high variability (p<0.001, adjusted r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.07). For the measurements taken when the soil in the raised beds had been recently disturbed these relationships were no longer significant (p>0.3, adjusted r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0, **Figure 2**).\n\nThe log transformation of the R<sub>h<\/sub> further strengthened our regression models. Across the regularly sampled data there was a significant relationship between WTD and logR<sub>h<\/sub> (linear model, p<0.001, **Table 5** equation (a)), with 81% of the total variance explained by the model (adjusted r<sup>2<\/sup>). Soil temperature also showed a significant relationship (linear model, p<0.001, **Table 5** equation (b)), but had a lower proportion of the total variance explained by the model (adjusted r<sup>2<\/sup> of 0.23). Linear regression of the logR<sub>h<\/sub> with WTD and soil temperature showed a significant relationship and 82% of the total variance explained by the model (**Table 5**, equation (c)).\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table 5: Linear models for soil and water table depth, for the regularly sampled morning and afternoon data and for when the data is split based on disturbance (i.e. disturbed data is from raised beds in May and November sampling occasions).}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Variables & Equation & Significance \\\\\n \\midrule\n WTD & Equation a:log R<sub>h<\/sub>= -2.21016-0.03812(WTD) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.81RMSE=0.46 \\\\\n \\hline\n Soil temperature & Equation b:log R<sub>h<\/sub>= -9.50964+0.46950(T<sub>s<\/sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.23RMSE=0.69 \\\\\n \\hline\n WTD and soil temperature & Equation c:log R<sub>h<\/sub>= -6.73021 - 0.01364(WTD) + 0.24705(T<sub>s<\/sub>)+0.00359(WTD × T<sub>s<\/sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.82RMSE=0.46 \\\\\n \\hline\n Regression model with WTD and disturbance & Equation d: *For disturbed soils*:log R<sub>h<\/sub>= -1.72578-0.03355(WTD) *For undisturbed soils*:log R<sub>h<\/sub> = -2.131514 -0.03355(WTD) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.83RMSE=0.40 \\\\\n \\hline\n Regression model with soil temperature and disturbance & Equation e: *For disturbed soils:*log R<sub>h<\/sub> = -3.3214+0.19291(T<sub>s<\/sub>) *For undisturbed soils:*log R<sub>h<\/sub> = -4.6571 + 0.19291(T<sub>s<\/sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.47RMSE=0.52 \\\\\n \\hline\n Regression model with WTD, soil temperature and disturbance & Equation f: *For disturbed soils*:log R<sub>h<\/sub>= -6.74386-0.13275(WTD)+ 0.27674(T<sub>s<\/sub>)+0.00537(WTD × T<sub>s<\/sub>) *For undisturbed soils*:log R<sub>h<\/sub>= -7.213513 -0.13275(WTD)+ 0.27674(T<sub>s<\/sub>)+ 0.00537(WTD × T<sub>s<\/sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =<\/sup> 0.84RMSE=0.39 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T5}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nIncluding the effect of disturbance, there was a significant relationship in the regressions of logR<sub>h<\/sub> with WTD, with soil temperature and with both WTD and soil temperature (p<0.001, **Table 5** equations (d), (e), (f)). Total variance explained was highest in the regression of logR<sub>h<\/sub> with WTD, soil temperature and disturbance (adjusted r<sup>2<\/sup> of 0.84, **Table 5**), and the best fit between predicted and actual values was also in this model (RMSE = 0.39, **Table 5** equation (f)).\n\n## 3.4 Area Weighed Emissions\n\nThe average width of the raised beds was 1.31 ± 0.07 m (± SE) and the average width of the trenches was 0.39 ± 0.1m. Taking into account the size of the study field, this is equivalent to 77 ± 4% (± SE) under raised beds and 23 ± 0.3% (± SE) under trenches. Taking the mean from all R<sub>h<\/sub> measurements, 1.397 ± 0.02 g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> (± SE) from the raised beds and 0.225 ± 0.005 g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> (± SE) from the trenches and area-weighing them based on the measured field dimensions provides a mean hourly emissions rate of 1.128 ± 0.019 g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup>, equivalent to a mean annual emissions rate of 98.79 ± 1.7 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> (± SE). While this annual loss estimate is simply based on the means of our measurements, future studies can refine this value through capturing further detail on environmental variables and soil use over the year.\n\n# 4 Discussion\n\n## 4.1 Range\n\nThe peat soils in this study site were a strong contributor to atmospheric CO<sub>2<\/sub>. Due to the mounding of soil to make the raised beds, the raised beds had a thicker layer of soil above the WTD than the trenches and thus showed significantly different rates of soil C loss with area weighed emissions from raised beds on average 10 times higher than from trenches per hectare across each month. While the mean hourly rate of R<sub>h<\/sub> from the trenches were nearly an order of magnitude lower than on the raised beds, they were still significant and comparable with those from other studies when considering a similar concept to the commonly applied micro-topographical classification of hummocks and hollows in peatland soils research. Jauhiainen et al., 2005 presented a range of hollow flux measurements between 0.1-0.9 g m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> from a tropical forest floor with WTD of 0 to -30 cm, of which our average monthly range in R<sub>h<\/sub> from the trenches sits at the lower end of, between 0.16 to 0.27 g m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> with a WTD of -9 to -28 cm.\n\nComparison with other literature from the African continent is difficult due to a lack of heterotrophic emissions studies on cultivated peat soils. Were et al. reported CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes from an intact, waterlogged wetland in eastern Uganda, with mean CO<sub>2<\/sub> fluxes reported to be between 2.4-2.5 g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> across different wetland vegetation types. This rate of flux is higher than we measured, but is assumed to include autotrophic respiration which our study does not. Carbon dioxide emissions from a cultivated Kenyan wetland (although not strictly R<sub>h<\/sub> as cut stems and roots were still present in collars) reported an approximate maximum of 0.3 g CO<sub>2<\/sub> m<sup>2<\/sup> hr<sup>-1<\/sup> which was at the lower end of our measured emissions, but was not on peat soils (organic carbon content < 5%).\n\n## 4.2 Temporal Variability\n\nWhile we observed a significant reduction in air temperature overnight, this was not reflected in the soil temperatures, which showed an increase in temperature into the night with any early morning cooling of the soils still within the range of daytime soil temperatures. The R<sub>h<\/sub> also exhibited little to no difference over the day and night-time measurements- indicating that variability in R<sub>h<\/sub> over a diurnal time frame is not a significant consideration in this site. This is likely to be due to no changes in WTD overnight (the variable that exhibited the strongest influence on emissions), and no soil cooling overnight (in fact a mean 0.4°C increase in nocturnal soil temperatures in both the raised beds and trenches across all measurements). This contrasts with other studies that describe higher soil temperatures and R<sub>h<\/sub> during the middle of the day. Other studies have observed lower diurnal temperatures compared to daytime measurements, and applied correction factors to adjust daytime flux measurements based on Q<sub>10<\/sub>. Instead, we saw a much stronger difference in the month-to-month observations, in both the measured environmental variables and the R<sub>h<\/sub>.\n\nThere are no comparative R<sub>h<\/sub> studies for drained peat soils within Uganda, and so comparison of our estimated annual emissions from these soils can only be done against tropical peats from other countries. Based on the area weighing of our measurements, our annual estimate of emissions from these peat soils of 98.79 ± 1.7 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> (SE) is within the higher range of emissions compared to other tropical peat fluxes. Southeast Asia provides a strong set of measurements from drained peatlands, in particular under oil palm plantations. Fluxes from SE Asia are highly variable, with an Rh of 18-56 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1 in drained forest and oil palm in Malaysia, 74-111 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> from a range of studies on drained oil palm plantations in SE Asia, and 24.9 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> in a young oil palm plantation in Borneo. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions factor for drained cropland and fallow in the tropics is 51 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup>. By comparison, peatlands under arable cropping in Europe, which involves annual ploughing of soils, have been shown to emit between 24-92 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup>. The management of peat soils in Uganda under potato cultivation involves an annual refreshment of the exposed peat from digging up of new peat to create new raised beds, thus exposing previously waterlogged soils to aerobic conditions. This introduction of fresh peat on an annual basis is different to the soil management of oil palm plantations in SE Asia where the soils are typically not disturbed post-planting. Therefore, it might be expected that the peat soils under repeated cultivation for potatoes would have emissions that remain high, unlike in sites that are not disturbed again after the initial planting period where emissions reduce after initial years since drainage [e.g. in where the initial emissions of 91 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> dropped to 47 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> over the first 6 years].\n\n## 4.3 Environmental variables\n\nThe relationships observed between WTD, soil temperature and R<sub>h<\/sub> were not unexpected, as this has previously been demonstrated in multiple studies. In some studies, this has been presented as a linear relationship with WTD or soil temperature only. As water table depth measurements do not require technical equipment, the relationship observed here has the potential for wide use by a variety of stakeholders to evaluate and model the impacts of hydrological management within these systems for reduced carbon losses.\n\nWhile we observed strong relationships in the soils which had not recently experienced disturbance, we had more varied and higher R<sub>h<\/sub> from the soils that had. Disturbance could cause changes to soil microbial and environmental properties, and has implications for future studies on these soils which need to take these impacts into account, especially when attempting to determine annual change. Other variables not measured here such as changes in soil bulk density, may have a significant combined effect on R<sub>h<\/sub> and will vary as a result of soil management over the year. There may also be an effect of the location of microbial biomass in the soil profile, which have been shown to be more prolific in the upper layers of the soil, with microbial extracellular enzymes involved in C cycling reducing with depth.\n\nDue to a lack of literature and available information on the use of these peat soils under this land use prior to our study, our sampling frequency was based on attempting to capture the range of environmental and management conditions that we anticipated would be experienced over the year. Considering that these soils are dug, cultivated, planted, harvested and fallowed at different times over a 12-month period, each of which bring different impacts to the soil, as well as differences in WTD and temperatures over the year, further studies should consider this when planning sampling and modelling of soil C losses. While our study succeeded in capturing different management and WTD conditions over the year, future studies could consider increased sampling intensity to a monthly emissions sampling campaign to ensure the extent of land management impacts are captured. Inclusion of regular soil sampling with these monthly measurements, in particular for bulk density and organic matter content, would enable further analysis of soil change and further refinement of relationships with key variables, and feed into model development and application for estimating land use impacts on these soils. Capturing the spatial variability from cultivated peatlands across the Kigezi highlands would strengthen the estimates of soil C losses for this peatland type and land use. Measurements of continuous *in-situ* WTD, soil and air temperature, and soil moisture content along with local climate data, would allow for accurate modelling of emissions over the longer term.\n\n## 4.4 Implications for Peatland Management\n\nIn terms of land management impacts and mitigation strategies, initial insight from this study shows considerable soil C losses due to soil drainage and disturbance. Although a number of years have passed since our field study was conducted, these management practices continue and thus these soil carbon losses are still relevant. Efforts to raise water levels would reduce these losses- one low-impact option for farmers could include the transfer of raised bed soils into trenches at the end of the harvest, to allow waterlogging of these soils during the fallow period. Alternatively, re-wetting and restoration of the wetland and exploration of alternative ecosystem service provision (including C payments for avoided emissions) or improved upland soil and crop management for enhanced incomes (and thus reduced household dependency on wetland cultivation) should also be explored. Before significant land management recommendations are made for these soils, the full GHG flux of the system should be further investigated, including the contribution of CH<sub>4<\/sub> emissions under waterlogged conditions, and the impact of the current land use including effects from the application of pesticides or fertilisers on water and soil quality.\n\n# 5 Conclusions\n\nManagement of these peat soils for potato cultivation leads to significant R<sub>h<\/sub>, in particular due to the mounding of fresh peats to ensure soils are raised above the water table. These raised beds had emissions nearly an order of magnitude higher than the trenches in between them.\n\nWhile there were lower air temperatures at night, nocturnal soil temperature and R<sub>h<\/sub> were not significantly affected and as such we conclude that there is no significant diurnal variability in emissions. Significant temporal variability was found over monthly time steps, rather than over hours or days, as we observed greater changes in key variables (soil temperature and WTD) from our measurements taken in the different months.\n\nSoil management (the different microtopography from the raised beds and trenches, and disturbance from planting and harvesting), as well as the soil temperature and water table depth were the most significant variables that impacted the rate of R<sub>h<\/sub>.\n\nOur area weighed annual flux estimate of 98.79 ± 1.7 t CO<sub>2<\/sub> ha<sup>-1<\/sup> yr<sup>-1<\/sup> is the first attempt at providing an emissions factor for this land use on these peat soils in Uganda.\n\n","tag":{"idx":29,"source":"geo-oapaper-v1"},"channel":"geo-oapaper"}
{"idx":1423996,"text":"Root Border Cells as a Convenient Single Cell System to Study Plant-Environmental Interactions: A Case Study for Aluminum Tolerance\n==============\n\nYingming Feng ,Xingyun Chen ,Xuewen Li ,Yalin Li ,Wei Nong ,Jiao Tang ,Hongxiang Han ,Lei Shi ,Sergey Shabala ,Min Yu\n\n# Abstract\n\nRoot border cells (RBCs) are a group of cells that originated from the root cap meristem, which are developed by genetic regulation and play a variety of biological functions. Being composed of a homologous single cell population with high metabolic activity and intact cell walls, RBCs represent a highly useful tool for studying various aspects of plant mineral absorption and utilization, as well as plant-soil-microbiome interactions in the rhizosphere. Research on RBCs also promise to become a hotspot in the context of understanding root adaptive responses to hostile environments. In order to take advantage of RBCs as an ideal single cell system in plant-environmental interactions, we summarized the production and function of RBCs and built-up the methodology for RBCs culturing, purification, and quantity control for plant research. The latter is done by using a case study of the application of RBCs to study mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants. This work offers plant scientists a new cognition of adopting RBCs as a convenient single cell system for the multidisciplinary research including (but not limited to) plant physiology, development and genetics, nutrition, and stress and adaptation. Root border cells (RBCs) are derived from the root cap and represent a population of living cells with special physiological activity and biological roles that are different from the root cap cells *per se*. After being separated from the root cap, RBCs become more active in metabolism than the progenitor root cap cells; for example, they incorporate labeled amino acids into protein 2.6-fold more efficiently than the cells of the root cap. In addition, mRNA and protein were differentially expressed between root cap cells and RBCs. Since the production of RBCs is genetically regulated and RBCs played a variety of biological functions in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses occurred in the rhizosphere, RBCs were suggested as an ideal single cell system for the study the response of plant root cells to nutrient availability, environmental stresses, and in plant-microbial interactions. Some studies revealed that RBCs, which development is regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals, are biologically viable in the majority of higher plant species. This work reviews the research on RBCs in plant environment interaction and describes the case study of RBCs as a convenient single cell system to study plant responses to Al toxicity.\n\n# 1 Production of RBCs and its Advantages as Plant Single Cell Line\n\n## 1.1 Production of RBCs\n\nRBCs are a group of specialized cells that dissociate from the epidermis of the root cap and gather around the root tip, which were previously called sloughed root cap cells. As early as 1919, Knudson had pointed out that some sloughed root cap cells were metabolically active; however, this had not attracted much attention from researchers at that time. In fact, more than 90% of the sloughed root cap cells in most species are alive, and their development is genetically regulated and shown to maintain a variety of biological functions even under adverse conditions. Hawes redefined these cells as RBCs, due to that they are located between the root surface and the soil, and emphasized that these cells were bioactive biotic boundary layers.\n\nRoot cap cells differentiate from root cap meristem through mitosis, and then go through a series of developmental stages such as starch synthesis stage, gravity sensing stage, and mucilage secretion stage to produce RBCs. The separation of border cells is the final stage of root cap cell development, and the total number of RBCs don’t increase indefinitely but tends to saturate. For example, during seed germination, the number of RBCs is positively correlated with the root elongation, but when the root length reaches about 2.5cm, the number of RBCs reaches the maximum value.\n\nThe efficiency of RBCs production differs among species. Based on the previous studies, we analyzed the proportion of RBCs from 11 families that contains nearly 30 different species. The number and viability of RBCs are different not only among plant families, but also within one family. The RBCs number varies greatly among different plant families, ranging from 20 in *Solanaceae* to ~12,000 in *Leguminou*s (**Figure 1**; ). As shown in **Figure 1**, RBCs number also varies greatly within one family, e.g. from about 5,000 in soybean ( *Glycine Max*) up to 12,000 in pea ( *Pisum sativum*). The environmental factors such as metal ions, the ratio of CO<sub>2<\/sub>\/O<sub>2,<\/sub> etc., also affect the production of RBCs. For example, the RBCs number increased from approximately 10,000 per root tip in the control to 12,000 after Al exposure (**Figure 1**; ). **Figure 1** and **Table 1** list the range of RBCs number among families and species affected by different metal ions. There is little doubt that RBCs function essentially at least among these plant species and respond actively to environmental signals especially stresses. Therefore, they represent natural homologous root cell lines that may be used in studying various aspects of plant-environmental interactions.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table 1: RBCs in the Study of Metal Toxicity.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n \\toprule\n Metals & References & Effect \\\\\n \\midrule\n \\multirow{7}{*}{Al toxicity} & Yu et al.

It has been reported that RBCs can quickly release antibiotics, specific enzymes, sugars, and other chemicals to regulate the growth of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes around the rhizosphere by changing gene expression under stress. Some scientists also called the RBCs as root extracellular traps (RET) and their associated secretions form a protective structure, which plays a major role in the interaction between roots and soil-borne microorganisms. In addition, as RBCs separation from root tip proceeds, the cells synthesize and secrete a hydrated mucilage that contains polysaccharides, secondary metabolites, antimicrobial proteins and extracellular DNA (exDNA), and this exDNA-based matrix seems to function in root defense in a way similar to that of recently characterized neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in mammalian cells. Therefore, the change of the rhizosphere can be communicated through the interaction between RBCs, various rhizosphere microorganisms, and toxic substances (such as Al toxicity), thereby generating practical significance.\n\nAt present, the role of RBCs in improving plant stress resistance, especially in resisting heavy metal ion toxicity, has become a new hotspot in the field of plant physiology. We summarized this research on the range of RBCs number in different families which were affected by metal stresses with the citation lists in **Figure 1**. Among these studies, more attention was paid to Al toxicity. Under Al stress, the elongation of the root is significantly inhibited in a few minutes, and the root tip is the main target of Al stress sensing and toxicity. However, the most sensitive zone to Al toxicity is not the root cap and meristem, but root transition zone, a zone 2-3 mm away from the root tip. RBCs, produced and gathered around the root cap and meristem (**Figure 2**), were assumed to not only prevent the protruding root tip from mechanical damage, but also act as a protective barrier for the root tip to absorb Al. When the Al concentration increased to 200 µM, the thickness of the adhesive layer exuded by RBCs increased, reducing the toxic effect of Al on roots. In addition, the removal of RBCs leads to the increase of Al absorption by root tip. As shown in **Figure 2**, in-depth research on the response of RBCs *in situ* or *in vitro* to Al toxicity was carried out (which will be discussed later), indicating RBCs have been successfully applied in Al research and can be an example of RBCs as a highly convenient single cell system for the study of plant-rhizosphere interactions.\n\n## 1.3 The Ideal Plant Single Cell System of RBCs\n\nAs a homologous single cell group with metabolic activity and complete cell wall, the discovery of RBCs provides a useful tool for studying many interesting research topics including (but not limited to) Al toxicity and tolerance, transport of nutrients and toxins through cell wall and plasma membrane, and a broad range of interactions (e.g. Si-Al, B-Al interaction) in the cell wall matrix. As RBCs are naturally produced in root tips of a large number of plant species, research on RBCs can reflect the real events that occurred in root tips, and the results are more reliable and applicable to root research in comparison to the other cell lines (e.g. suspension cells) or protoplast (without cell wall) and organelles (vacuoles), although they have other merits.\n\nThe second advantage is that RBCs can be acquired simply just by collection in water or solution, or even directly be wiped onto the glass slides for observation. It is well-known that the process of producing a new plant cell line generally takes a few years. The uniform population of protoplasts can be produced quicker (within several hours) but requires a prior optimization of the cocktail of enzymatic solution which is time consuming and may take months. Protoplasts are also highly artificial as they lack cell walls (and hence many wall-anchored proteins) as well as have non-physiological resting membrane potential values that questions applicability of findings on protoplasts to explain planta responses. There are no other plant tissues that can be distinguished and dissected so easily without any complex instrumentation and isolation processes. Also, RBCs can survive for a long time in a large osmotic potential range including distilled water without disintegration or visible cell damage.\n\nAnother advantage is the homogeneity of the RBCs that responds consistently to the chemicals, stresses, or signals which has a great advantage over root heterogeneity as cells from different root zones (root caps, meristem, transition, elongation, and mature zones) function and respond differently. Protoplasts derived from a specific cell type also possess this feature but creating a homogenous protoplast population may require cell-specific fluorescent labeling and the use of highly expensive and sophisticated techniques (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Most critically, lacking cell walls, protoplasts cannot be used to study the response of whole single cells to chemicals, stresses, and signals in the apoplast limiting their applicability in stress physiology.\n\nLast but not the least, previous studies have shown that the RBCs and their mucilage could form a protective sheath at the root tip, which prevented Al from diffusing into the root tip, thereby alleviating Al stress in plant root tip. The mucilage consists of a variety of molecules including cell wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans, secondary metabolites, anti-microbial proteins and peptides, and extracellular DNA. Mucilage can strongly bind Al in the rhizosphere. The mucilage can protect root tips from Al toxicity by tightly binding Al and sequestrating Al in mucilage, which consequently reduced the inhibition of root growth induced by Al and the absorption of Al by roots. Therefore, RBCs are considered to be the front of plant response and defense to stresses. Considering RBCs are easier to be harvested in large quantities and easily purified, they are widely used in studies on Al toxicity. Of specific interest is pea ( *Pisum sativum*) - Mendel’s model genetic material that are capable to produce up to 10,000 RBCs from one root tip.\n\n# 2 Methodological Aspects of RBCs Production and Use: A Case Study for Al Response and Tolerance\n\n## 2.1 Production of RBCs\n\n### 2.1.1 Modified Solid Media Culture\n\nPea seeds are generally germinated in a Petri dish with sterilized 1.0% agar, and then a small amount of RBCs derived from the pea roots is harvested for further analysis. If required, the chemicals can be applied to the agar preparation. To maximize the cell yield, the growth procedure was modified as follows. Firstly, pea seeds are soaked in 0.1-2.0 mmol\/L CaCl<sub>2<\/sub> for 10-48 h after sterilization in 7.5% sodium-hypochlorite solution. Then, the fully soaked seeds are transferred to the solid agar using tweezers, and a layer of filter paper is put on the culture medium to prevent the root tip to penetrate the culture medium. The cells are then cultured in a 20-32°C incubator for 24-72 h (depending on plant growth rate) and collected when the root length reaches 1.0-5.0 cm. Cells can be collected by immersing root tips in water and gently rotating to detach the RBCs from the root. The solid media culture was previously widely used for pathology studies as it can be completely sterilized and can conveniently incorporate the treatment of microorganisms. However, it is difficult to count the number of RBCs since RBCs will fall off when they are touched during the sampling process, which affects the experimental results. Also, a large number of RBCs could be potentially obtained by cutting off many root tips (one by one) from plants grown in multiple Petri dishes. However, it is practically not feasible since it is time and labor-consuming and the viability of the RBCs will drop significantly if separated from the root tips for more than 3 h. So the modified solid media culture is most suitable for the research requiring a small amount of RBCs and studies that require strict sterility.\n\n### 2.1.2 Mist Culture\n\nMist culture was invented for the mass harvest of RBCs by Yu’s group and it was found that mist culture could quickly collect a large number of RBCs with high metabolic activity. The method involves the use of a mist incubator (depicted in **Figure 3**) composed of a sealed box to keep the humidity, a plastic mesh rack to support seeds, a mist generator to produce fine mist for seed germination, a timer to control the operation of the mist generator. Seeds are put on the mesh rack and a mist generator is regularly used to keep the humidity in the sealed box at a constant level to ensure the normal growth and development of seeds. The mist production is controlled by a timer with a 15 s spaying time and at the time interval of 5 min, which can ensure the humidity in the box of 98%, and the temperature is controlled at 22-24°C. Under the plant gravitropism, the germinated root tips are neatly distributed under the mesh. After the roots are elongated to 2-3 cm, the mesh rack can be removed from the sealed box and put into water to collect RBCs. In addition, during the culture process, the nutrient composition may be modified as per purpose of the experiment, and various signaling and chemical agents could be also dispersed by mist generator.\n\n### 2.1.3 Quality and Quantity Control of Harvested RBCs\n\nThe RBCs are generally harvested (or collected) in the solution of the same chemical composition as for germination (0.1-2.0 mmol\/L CaCl<sub>2<\/sub>). Cells are then purified by centrifugation at a centrifugal force of less than 500 (×g) to 1-3 times depending on the experiment requirement. Then the viability and number of RBCs are generally checked under a microscope for the quality and quantity control of the RBCs for further research. Generally, the total number of the pelleted RBCs is used to control the next experiment under the same amount of cell numbers. Some of these issues are discussed in more detail in the case study of Al tolerance below.\n\n## 2.2 The Case Study of RBCs in Research of Al Tolerance\n\n### 2.2.1 The Detection of the Number and Viability of RBCs Under Al Stress\n\nIt is a direct method to study the response of RBCs to Al stress by detecting the cell activity or quantity\/proportion of viable cells. The number of cells can be counted by hemocytometer or by visual microscopic observations. For activity detection, many methods have been used, such as FDA (Fluorescent Diacetate) - PI (Propidium Iodide) viability staining, TTC (Triphenylte-trazolium Chloride) staining and trypan blue exclusion staining. Trypan blue is a cell reactive dye, and is commonly used to detect the activity of RBCs. In a living cell, the intact cell membrane can prevent trypan blue from entering the cells, so it will not be stained. If the membrane integrity is broken, the dead cells will be stained in blue due. During the operation of the trypan blue exclusion method, the solution containing RBCs and 0.5% trypan blue staining solution is mixed at 1:1 (V\/V) and stained in the dark for 15 min. The blue-stained cells are dead cells and the non-stained cells are living cells. The cell survival rate is calculated according to the distribution of cells of the two colors under the microscope. RBCs in the majority of species examined are >90% viable. However, RBCs separated from the root cap died within 24 h under Al<sup>3+<\/sup> stress while the *in vitro* RBCs maintained 85% viability at 48 h after treatment.\n\n### 2.2.2 Removing Extracellular Al Ions From RBCs\n\nRBCs can also be used to study the absorption kinetics of specific ions by single cells. When RBCs are treated *in vitro*, some metal ions treated outside or secreted by cells are required to be removed because of the reaction conditions of each element in the cells to be determined, as to purify RBCs. Generally, two methods are frequently used; one is microporous membrane filtration, and the second one is purification by centrifugation. Microporous membrane purification uses a 0.4~5 µm filter membrane to purify cells. The advantage of this method is that it is fast, accurate, and will not wash off cells. However, the method comes with the danger of mechanically damaging cells thus affecting their operation and viability. The centrifugal purification method is gentler. RBCs are centrifugated with a centrifugal force of less than 500 (×g), and lots machines, such as ICP(Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer), can be used to measure the degree of extracellular Al washing of each cell. The extracellular Al is completely removed after the 3-4 times centrifugation.\n\n### 2.2.3 Changes of Cell Wall Components of RBCs Under Al Stress\n\nThe cell wall is in the outermost layer of the cell. As the initial part of Al contact, it is the first barrier for plants to deal with Al stress, both the initial site of Al toxicity, and the main part of Al accumulation. The accumulation of Al in the cell wall is a prerequisite for the toxicity of Al to plant root tips. Pectin in the cell wall can promote the tolerance of plants to Al by regulating its distribution, so the combination of Al and cell wall polysaccharides plays an important role in the expression of Al toxicity and tolerance in plants. In the analysis of cell wall components, The extraction of cell wall and the separation of cell wall polysaccharide components were carried out according to Takayuki etal.. The total sugar of cell wall can be determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method based on glucose; uronic acid is determined by pyrocatechol colorimetry; and pectin content is analyzed and determined according to the method of Li etal.. Through the study of the interaction between cell wall and Al, the experimental conditions for the tolerance of root border cells to Al ion stress were established and optimized, so as to better study the physiological and biochemical mechanism of Al toxicity at the cell level and provide a direct method for the screening of Al tolerant germplasm in the future.\n\n### 2.2.4 Biomineralization of Al in RBCs\n\nThe biomineralization process of cell induced self-assembly to form nanostructures has been a great interest subject to biologists and material chemists for many years. It is a process in which a small number of organic macromolecules (polysaccharides, proteins, and glycoproteins) are used as templates for a molecular operation to control the nucleation and growth of mineral phases and combine them into inorganic materials in a highly orderly manner. Inspired by nature, many researchers imitate the sheath structure outside biological cells by physical, chemical, or biochemical methods, especially the chemical modification method, which is a technology to prepare polyelectrolyte multilayer coating by alternately depositing anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on the solid surface through electrostatic interaction. Among them, layer-by-layer self-assembly (LBL) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) induction technology are common chemical modification methods. In recent years, chemical modification methods have been applied to yeast cells and rice suspension cells. The results show that the deposition of nano silicon can inhibit the entry of Cd<sup>2+<\/sup> into cells and effectively alleviate cadmium toxicity. For RBCs, Feng etal. applied layer-by-layer self-assembly technology to pea RBCs, showing that nanosilicon can keep the mitochondrial function of RBCs normal under Al stress, reduce the burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and finally reduce the programmed cell death, so that RBCs can maintain high viability without significant difference from the control group. This mechanism is like the RBCs in response to Al toxicity described in **Figure 2**. Briefly, nano silicon deposition confers cells with high Al resistance. In addition, *in situ* RBCs can be used to study the change of cell wall mechanical properties and cell ion homeostasis under Al stress. Thus, RBCs offer material scientists a new single cell system for studing biomineralization.\n\n# 3 Prospects\n\nThe use of RBCs provides significant competitive advantages for plant cell physiology research compared with the other plant cell lines or protoplast-based methods. Studies involving RBCs are becoming a hot spot in the research of developmental biology, plant nutrition, and plant-environmental interactions. Adopting RBCs in research of Al toxicity provides opportunities for understanding the mechanisms underlying Al tolerance making the use of the cutting edge techniques such as microelectrode ion flux estimation(MIFE). There is also an exciting possibility of utilizing RBCs in research on biomineralization. We believe that RBCs, as an ideal single cell system, may disclose more molecular mechanisms of the response of cells to surrounding signals, if taken in combination with modern molecular tools such as single cell omics techniques.

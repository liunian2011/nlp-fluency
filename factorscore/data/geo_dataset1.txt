__label__1, Stratigraphy and Historical Geology,Principles of Sequence Stratigraphy,,,Principles of Sequence Stratigraphy, Second Edition presents principles to practical workflow that guide applications in a consistent manner that is independent of model, geological setting and the types and resolution of the data available. The book explains the points of agreement and difference between the various approaches to sequence stratigraphy, while also defining the common ground that affords the standard application of the method. This enables the practitioner to avoid nomenclatural and methodological confusions and apply sequence stratigraphy. The text is richly illustrated with hundreds of full-color diagrams and examples of outcrop, borehole and seismic data.  The book's balanced approach helps students and professionals acquire a sound understanding of the concepts and methodology. It will appeal to geologists, geophysicists and engineers with interest in basin analysis, stratigraphy and sedimentology, as well as in all economic applications that concern the exploration and production of natural resources, including water, hydrocarbons, coal and sediment-hosted mineral deposits.
__label__1, Physical Oceanography,Data Analysis Methods in Physical Oceanography,,,Data Analysis Methods in Physical Oceanography, Third Edition is a practical reference to established and modern data analysis techniques in earth and ocean sciences. Its five major sections address data acquisition and recording, data processing and presentation, statistical methods and error handling, analysis of spatial data fields, and time series analysis methods. The revised Third Edition updates the instrumentation used to collect and analyze physical oceanic data and adds new techniques including Kalman Filtering. Additionally, the sections covering spectral, wavelet, and harmonic analysis techniques are completely revised since these techniques have attracted significant attention over the past decade as more accurate and efficient data gathering and analysis methods.

__label__1, Geomorphology,Mountain Geomorphology,,,Mountains represent one of the most inspiring and attractive natural features on the surface of the earth. Visually, they dominate the landscape. However, the increasing realization of the fragility of mountain areas because of changes in land use, management and climate, combined with an understanding of their importance for water and other natural resources, has resulted in a growing interest in mountain environments in recent years. Hence, Mountain Geomorphology represents a timely and unique contribution to the literature.    Written by a team of international experts, this book is divided into three sections, which consider historical, functional and applied mountain geomorphology from both global and local perspectives. Historical mountain geomorphology focuses on the evolution of landforms. Functional mountain geomorphology emphasises the interaction between processes and landforms, while applied mountain geomorphology concerns the interrelationships between geomorphological processes and society.    Mountain Geomorphology is a valuable source of information for students studying mountain geomorphology, and also for academics and research scientists interested in mountain environments.

__label__1, Seismology,Introduction to Volcanic Seismology 2nd Edition,,,Volcanic seismology represents the main, and often the only, tool to forecast volcanic eruptions and to monitor the eruption process. This book describes the main types of seismic signals at volcanoes, their nature and spatial and temporal distributions at different stages of eruptive activity. Following from the success of the first edition, published in 2003, the second edition consists of 19 chapters including significant revision and five new chapters. Organized into four sections, the book begins with an introduction to the history and topic of volcanic seismology, discussing the theoretical and experimental models that were developed for the study of the origin of volcanic earthquakes. The second section is devoted to the study of volcano-tectonic earthquakes, giving the theoretical basis for their occurrence and swarms as well as case stories of volcano-tectonic activity associated with the eruptions at basaltic, andesitic, and dacitic volcanoes. There were 40 cases of volcanic eruptions at 20 volcanoes that occurred all over the world from 1910 to 2005, which are discussed. General regularities of volcano-tectonic earthquake swarms, their participation in the eruptive process, their source properties, and the hazard of strong volcano-tectonic earthquakes are also described. The third section describes the theoretical basis for the occurrence of eruption earthquakes together with the description of volcanic tremor, the seismic signals associated with pyroclastic flows, rockfalls and lahars, and volcanic explosions, long-period and very-long-period seismic signals at volcanoes, micro-earthquake swarms, and acoustic events. The final section discuss the mitigation of volcanic hazard and include the methodology of seismic monitoring of volcanic activity, the examples of forecasting of volcanic eruptions by seismic methods, and the description of seismic activity in the regions of dormant volcanoes.  This book will be essential for students and practitioners of volcanic seismology to understand the essential elements of volcanic eruptions.

__label__1, Physics of the Earth's Interior,Constitution of the Earth's Interior,,,Constitution of the Earth's Interior discusses the physical and evolutionary principles connecting various elements of the knowledge about structure and dynamics of the Earth's interior. This work is divided into eight chapters that primarily focus on the physical, chemical, and petrological state. This text contains general data on a general stationary model, which is described by equations of state combining the basic parameters, including pressure, temperature, density, gravity acceleration, and mineral composition within the Earth's interior. Considerable chapters concern the chemical and petrological composition of the matter in the Earth's interior. The remaining chapters describe models containing inhomogeneities used to illustrate processes connected with phase transitions. This book will be of great value to geologists, physicists, and researchers.

__label__1, World Geography,World Regional Geography,,,The sixth edition of WORLD REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY offers you a rich cultural and physical geographic understanding of the world's eight regions. In the text's ''Profile'' chapters, the author presents brief, thematic overviews for each of the eight regions. Subsequent regional chapters present traditional, current details on a local level, including geographical factors and in-depth observations. The art program offers many new and revised maps, as well as photos submitted by the author that depict cultural and geographic aspects of the world's eight regions. New and extensively revised thematic maps centered on topics like language, religion, and ethnicity allow you to make cultural and regional comparisons quickly. You have access to these maps electronically for further study and use in the classroom. Clearly outlined chapter objectives emphasize more thematic discussions in the subregional chapters as well as highlighted textual discussions. The author also ties in relevant historical geography to give you a context for current events and geopolitical issues in the world.,
__label__1, Paleontology,Genetics, Paleontology and Macroevolution,,,This expanded and updated second edition offers a comprehensive look at macroevolution and its underpinnings, with a primary emphasis on animal evolution. From a Neodarwinian point of view, the book integrates evolutionary processes at all levels to explain the diversity of animal life. It examines a wide range of topics including genetics, speciation, development, evolution, constructional and functional aspects of form, fossil lineages, and systematics, and --in a major new chapter--takes a hard look at the Cambrian explosion. The author delves into the age of molecular science and integrates important recent contributions made to our understanding of evolution.
__label__1, Other Subjects of Space Physics,Physics of Space Plasma Activity,,,Space plasma is so hot that the atoms break up into charged particles which then become trapped and stored in magnetic fields. When critical conditions are reached the magnetic field breaks up, releasing a large amount of energy and causing dramatic phenomena. The largest space plasma activity events observed in the solar system occur on the Sun, when coronal mass ejections expel several billion tons of plasma mass into space. This book provides a coherent and detailed treatment of the physical background of large plasma eruptions in space. It provides the background necessary for dealing with space plasma activity, and allows the reader to reach a deeper understanding of this fascinating natural event. The book employs both fluid and kinetic models, and discusses the applications to magnetospheric and solar activity. This will form an interesting reference for graduate students and academic researchers in the fields of astrophysics and plasma physics.
__label__1, Planetary Geology,Planetary Tectonics,,,This book describes the tectonic landforms resulting from major internal and external forces acting on the outer layers of solid bodies throughout the Solar System. It presents a detailed survey of tectonic structures at a range of length scales found on Mercury, Venus, the Moon, Mars, the outer planet satellites, and asteroids. A diverse range of models for the sources of tectonic stresses acting on silicate and icy crusts is outlined, comparing processes acting throughout the Solar System. Rheological and mechanical properties of planetary crusts and lithospheres are discussed to understand how and why tectonic stresses manifest themselves differently on various bodies. Results from fault population data are assessed in detail. The book provides methods for mapping and analyzing planetary tectonic features, and is illustrated with diagrams and spectacular images returned by manned and robotic spacecraft. It forms an essential reference for researchers and students in planetary geology and tectonics.

__label__1, Upper Atmospheric Physics,Physics and Chemistry of the Upper Atmosphere,,,This textbook focuses on the physics and chemistry of the Earth's upper atmosphere, which is bounded at the bottom by a pressure level at which most of the incoming ionizing radiation has been absorbed, and bounded at the top by the level at which the escape of gas becomes important. The plan of the book is to identify the multitude of processes that operate in the upper atmosphere, and to relate them to observed phenomena by detailed mathematical and physical descriptions of the governing processes. Basic information from many disciplines such as radiation physics and chemistry, fluid dynamics, optics, and spectroscopy is skilfully marshalled to give a coherent account of the upper atmosphere. This book is outstanding as an introduction to the primary literature and current problems for students of physics or chemistry. The text is supported by numerous diagrams, bibliography and index.
__label__1, Seismology,Seismology and Plate Tectonics,,,This textbook is unique in giving an introduction to seismological theory and the principles of plate tectonics, as well as developing a practical approach to the reading and interpretation of seismograms. The book forms the basis for an introductory course to physicists, mathematicians and geologists. The early chapters give a general background in geophysics and elasticity theory, and present the standard results for the propagation of seismic waves radiated from large earthquakes. The main part of the text describes how seismograms are read and interpreted, explaining how the readings are used to locate the source of the waves, determine the sense of motion across the fault and to work out details of plate movements. Examples are included in which the reader has the opportunity to interpret seismic records and use them to find locations of earthquakes and determine their source mechanisms. The final chapter discusses plate tectonic theory, and gives the mathematical foundation behind the description of plate movement in terms of vectors.
__label__1, Physical Oceanography,Inverse Methods in Physical Oceanography,,,Professor Bennett's work explores the potential for inverse theory, emphasizing possibilities rather than expedient or rudimentary applications. In addition to interpolating the data and adding realism to the model solutions, the methods can yield estimates for unobserved flow variables, forcing fields, and model parameters. Inverse formulations can resolve ill-posed modeling problems, lead to design criteria for oceanic observing systems, and enable the testing of models as scientific hypothesis. Ocean models considered range from linear, finite-dimensional systems of equality and inequality constraints, to nonlinear, regional primitive-equation models. Examples from the recent oceanographic literature are analyzed, and several outstanding research problems are surveyed. The methods employ solution techniques including Kalman filters and smoothers, representer expansions and descent algorithms. Exercises of varying difficulty rehearse technical skills and supplement the central theoretical development.
__label__1, Upper Atmospheric Physics,An Introduction to Atmospheric Physics,,,This advanced undergraduate textbook clearly details how physics can be used to understand many important aspects of atmospheric behavior.

__label__1, Polar Science,Icons of Space,,Geography,Life Sciences and Space Research, Volume XVIII is a collection of articles on space biology. The book describes the presence of organic molecules found in interstellar space, comets, and meteorites.   The text also addresses the role of comets in giving rise to new studies in cometary chemistry, as the source of plasma, or as supplying the mechanism for the formation of amino acids, glycine, and guanine. One paper addresses the possibility of life on the planet Mars touching on chemical reactions of nutrient compound decay and other physio-chemical changes. The book also notes the contribution of cometary volatiles to the study of the primitive earth plus the possible role of metal ions and clays in prebiotic chemistry. Other papers discuss radiation biology concerning both radiobiological results from experiments done in spaceflight and ground laboratories such as the degeneration of rabbit tissues after heavy irradiation.   The book then evaluates gravitational biology, including topics such as physiological reactions during acute adaptation to reduced gravity; land plant evolution and gravity; and the development of Polyporus brumalis basidomycete, a kind of fungi, in conditions of weightlessness.   Molecular biologists, space engineers, biologists, meteorologists, and genetic engineers will find this book highly valuable.

In coastal areas, they are under ever greater pressure due to population growth, more affluent lifestyles, food production and the growing tourism industry. Changes to the coastal landscape, through urbanisation and land reclamation, and by natural processes such as climate change and sea level rise, modify the interaction between seawater and groundwater and put water resources at risk. This comprehensive volume covers both theory and practice of coastal hydrogeology. It discusses hydrochemistry; submarine groundwater discharge; groundwater management; palaeo-hydrology; land reclamation; climate change and sea level rise; and mathematical models of variable-density flow. With its up-to-date coverage and numerous case studies that illustrate practical implications, it is perfect for students, practitioners, managers and researchers who wish to develop an in-depth understanding of topics relevant to sustainably managing coastal groundwater resources.

__label__1, Hydrogeology,Applied Mathematics in Hydrogeology,,,As introduced in Dr. Lee's 10-week class, Applied Mathematics in Hydrogeology is written for professionals and graduate students who have a keen interest in the application of mathematics in hydrogeology. Its first seven chapters cover analytical solutions for problems commonly encountered in the study of quantitative hydrogeology, while the final three chapters focus on solving linear simultaneous equations, finite element analysis, and inversion for parameter determination. Dr. Lee provides various equation-solving methods that are of interest to hydrogeologists, geophysicists, soil scientists, and civil engineers, as well as applied physicists and mathematicians. In the classroom, this same information will help students realize how familiar equations in hydrogeology are derived-an important step toward development of a student's own mathematical models. Unlike other applied mathematics books that are structured according to systematic methodology, Applied Mathematics in Hydrogeology emphasizes equation-solving methods according to topics. Hydrogeological problems and governing differential equations are introduced, including hydraulic responses to pumping in confined and unconfined aquifers, as well as transport of heat and solute in flowing groundwater.

__label__1, Isotope Geochronology,Radiogenic Isotope Geology,,Earth and Environmental Sciences, Geochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Mineralogy, Petrology and Volcanology,The third edition of Radiogenic Isotope Geology examines revolutionary changes in geochemical thinking that have occurred over the past fifteen years. Extinct-nuclide studies on meteorites have called into question fundamental geochemical models of the Earth, while new dating methods have challenged conventional views of Earth history. At the same time, the problem of global warming has raised new questions about the causes of past and present climate change. In the new edition, these and other recent issues are evaluated in their scholarly and historical context, so readers can understand the development of current ideas. Controversial theories, new analytical techniques, classic papers, and illustrative case studies all come under scrutiny in this book, providing an accessible introduction for students and critical commentary for researchers.

Barry Maynard's interest in the chemistry of sedimentary rocks. In his teaching of geochemistry, he has found that the study of ore deposits offers the best examples for many chemical processes, which led to the creation of a course entitled "Sedimentary Ore Deposits" at The University of Cincinnati. The book is based on the teaching experience from this course and provides a treatment that combines sedimentological perspectives with the study of ore deposits, drawing heavily on the ideas and techniques of Robert Garrels.
__label__1, River Science and Estuarial Hydrology,Hydrological changes and estuarine dynamics,,,Water development projects have altered the environmental flow landscapes where dams and diversions have been built, and this could have effects on coastal resources, particularly in estuaries. Water is an important human resource and water needs grow as populations grow.  However, freshwater inflow to the coast is fundamental to the functioning of estuaries.  Can we have stable, secure, and sufficient water resources for people and still protect estuarine health?  Estuaries are the most productive environments on Earth, and this is in part due to freshwater inflow, which dilutes marine water, and transports nutrients and sediments to the coast.  Estuaries are characterized by salinity and nutrient gradients, which are important in regulating many biological processes.  As water is diverted for human consumption, it is common for many environmental problems to appear.  While many countries have water quality programs, few are dealing with water quantity alterations. The first step is to define marine resources to protect, and the water quality conditions those resources need to thrive. The second step is to determine the flow regimes needed to maintain the desired water quality conditions.  Finally, many regions are using adaptive management programs to manage freshwater resources.  These programs set goals to protect ecosystem resources, identify indicators, and monitor the indicators over time to ensure that the goals are appropriate and resources are protected.  Case studies demonstrate that monitoring and research can determine the ecological and socio-economical impacts of altered freshwater inflows, and stakeholders and managers can make well-informed decisions to manage freshwater inflows to local coasts wisely.

This book contains five chapters, and begins with a presentation of scientific and engineering advances in the field of sonar and hydroelasticity. The following chapter deals with the fundamental principles and concepts of statistical hydrodynamics in porous media and their significance in various engineering applications. These topics are followed by a discussion on the concepts of theoretical incompressible fluid dynamics, with a special emphasis on the field of hydroballistics. The last chapter provides first a brief introduction to the basic principles and fundamental equations of well hydraulics, followed by a survey of its importance to water economy in arid and semiarid regions of the world. This book will be of great value to research workers and practitioners in the interdisciplinary field of hydroscience.
__label__1, Hydrophysics,Advances in Hydroscience Volume 4,,,Advances in Hydroscience, Volume 4 covers selected topics encompassing several areas of special interest in hydroscience, including naval architecture, water waves, subsurface water, engineering hydraulics, and stochastic hydrology. This volume is composed of seven chapters, and begins with a summary of the basic principles and theories involved in hovering craft operating over water, which should be of interest to naval architects who may design such vehicles for special purposes. The succeeding chapters deal with the significance of soil moisture theory in the design of foundations and land drainage systems, as well as the developments in understanding the theory of wind-generated waves. These topics are followed by discussions on the mode of operation and different types of hydraulic jumps and the basic probability concepts of stochastic reservoir theory. The final chapter the fundamentals of surface winds, wind fields, and wind stress and their role in formation of storm surge. This book is of value to hydrologists, naval architects, agronomists, and agricultural civil engineers.

__label__1, Physics of the Earth's Interior,Physics of the earth's interior,,,Physics of the Earth's Interior embraces such a wide range of properties and processes that the space available in one volume imposes severe limitations on their discussion. Moreover, the uneven familiarity of any geophysicist with the many fields of natural science which are involved favors their uneven treatment. For these reasons, the author has limited discussions related to gravity, terrestrial magnetism, tectonic processes, and the history of the earth, to such problems which, if solved, may give information on the earth's interior. On the other hand, seismological investigations are discussed only insofar as they bear upon the structure of the earth and the physics of its interior; seismology is to be treated in detail in another monograph of this series. The book contains nine chapters and begins with a discussion of methods of investigating the earth's interior, and the accuracy of the results. This is followed by separate chapters on the structure of the earth; the crust, mantle, and core; temperature and thermal processes in the earth; density, pressure, gravity, and flattening in the earth; elastic constants, and elastic processes; and nonelastic processes in the earth.

__label__1, Polar Science,Arctic Abstractive Industry,,Anthropology;environmental studies;development studies,Through diverse engagements with natural resource extraction and ecological vulnerability in the contemporary Arctic, contributors to this volume apprehend Arctic resource regimes through the concept of abstraction. Abstraction refers to the creation of new material substances and cultural values by detaching parts from existing substances and values. The abstractive process differs from the activity of extractive industries by its focus on the conceptual resources that conceal processes of exploitation associated with extraction. The study of abstraction can thus help us attune to the formal operations that make appropriations of value possible while disclosing the politics of extraction and of its representation.

__label__1, Coal Geology,European coal geology,,,Despite extensive closure of underground mines throughout the European Union, coal remains a major energy source and the growing energy demands of developing countries mean that the world's coal consumption continues to increase. The European Union has long-established coalfields and considerable research experience in coal exploitation and use, all of which will be important in the future development of coal. This volume covers many aspects of European coal geology and illustrates the depth and breadth of research from sedimentological, geochemical and exploration models, to exploration drilling and economic evaluation of coal deposits, on a local and country-wide scale, as well as the environmental aspects of coal burning and disposal of C02. The book will fill a gap in the literature on regional coal deposits, having encouraged papers in which description of such deposits is specifically orientated towards the application of the research in the exploration for, exploitation of and environmental considerations required in the study of coal. The well-balanced content of the book should provide a particularly attractive read for those who seek an update on some of the coal deposits of Europe. Such an extensive spectrum of papers will appeal to a wide audience, ranging from researchers, lecturers and students to professionals in industry.--Provided by publisher.

__label__1, Marine Chemistry,Bioorganic Marine Chemistry,,,The first three chapters of Vol. 3 of Bio-organic Marine Chemistry deal with the chemistry and function of peptides. Chapter 1 by Ireland and coworkers serves as an introduction to marine-derived peptides. It is arranged phyletically and encompasses the entire range from dipeptides to a compound with 95 amino acid residues. Peptides involved in primary metabolism and hence belonging to the realm of macromolecular biochemistry are excluded. However, it might be mentioned in passing that the dividing line between large and small molecule chemistry is continually becoming less distinct. Not only are more compounds of intermediate size, from 1,000 to 10,000 dalton, being discovered, but instruments and techniques, particularly in mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance have been developed for their structural elucidation by what is considered small molecule methodology. Two groups of peptides are discussed in separate chapters. Biologists who have observed and described the mating behavior of diverse species of marine invertebrates have long surmised that a chemical mechanism might be operating in many cases of individual as well as mass fertilization. The chemical activators of sea urchin sperm prove to be a series of peptides, whose structures and activity are discussed by Suzuki.

__label__1, Marine Geography and Estuarine and Coastal Science,Encyclopedia of Marine Sciences,,,Marine science today is an area of rapid expansion. Scientific activity is in creasing, and a growing number of scientists are involved in one or more of its disciplines. For a thorough understanding of the marine environment. for its exploration, exploitation and management. background knowledge of more than one discipline is required. A clear need therefore exists for a concise multidisciplinary oceanographic encyclopedia. The initiative for this book was taken by the Netherland Institute of Sea Research. NIOZ, TexeL a multidisciplinary institute, founded in 1876. The encyclopedia contains some 1850 entries, 210 of which in marine chem istry. 330 in physical oceanography. 350 in marine geology and 940 in marine biology, while the remaining 20 are general terms. Concepts. terminology and methods of the various disciplines are briefly explained and especially in the description of marine processes the book tries to be more than a glossary or dictionary. It tries to provide a succinct overview of the major topics in marine science. Students, teachers, and scientists as well as interested laymen may use it to find an explanation of oceanographic terms outside their own fields. The manuscript was read by a variety of potential users, whose comments were used to improve and clarify the descriptions.

__label__1, Limnology,The Amazon,,,The Amazon -that name was given to the biggest river on earth and is often used for the whole area of its basin too. This geographical region is currently referred to as Amazonia, thus emphasizing the peculiar character of its aquatic and terrestrial reaches. The Amazon embodied the dream of many a naturalist to explore what for a long time was a terra incognita. In recent years, however, Amazonia has emerged as a main centre for 'development' by some of the countries in which it lies and by foreign industrialized nations. The development projects and enterprises have aroused woridwide interest and have given rise to discussions on their aims and their consequences to the Amazonian nature. Limnological and ecological investigations in Amazonia started only about 40 years ago. The editor had the good fortune to partake in them from the very beginning. He spent his decisive years in Amazonia, and dedicated his life's work to that research and to that country and the Amazonian people. Nearing the end of his scicntific activities, hc is gratcful to bc ablc to summarizc in this book most of the knowledge we possess at present of Amazonian limnology and landscape ecology.

__label__1, Physical Oceanography,Physical Oceanography of the Adriatic Sea ,,,Because of its centrallocation in the Old World, the Adriatic Sea has long been explored and studied. Modern methods of investigation, however, have accelerated the pace of study during the last decade. These are the ADCP currentmeter, satellite imagery, drifter technology, and, last but not least, the computer with its arsenal of tools for data analysis and model simulations. As a result of this renaissance, the Adriatic Sea and its sub-basins are currently the object of intensified scrutiny by a number of scientific teams, in Europe and be yond. Questions concerning the mesoscale variability that dominates regional motions, the seasonal circulation of the sea, and its long-term climatic role in the broader Mediterranean, have become topics of lively discussions. The time was ripe then when an international workshop dedicated to the physical oceanography of the Adriatic Sea was convened in Trieste on 21-25 September 1998. Its objectives were to assess the current knowledge of the oceanography of the Adriatic Sea, to review the newly acquired observations, to create syn ergy between model simulations and observations, and to identify directions for future Adriatic oceanography. This book, however,is not the mere proceedings of the workshop. It was written as a monograph synthetizing the current knowledge of the physical oceanography of the Adriatic Sea, with the hope that it will serve as a reference to anyone interested in the Adriatic. The book also identifies topics in need of additional inquiry and proposes research directions for the next decade.

By means of on-site monitoring, theoretical analysis and indoor simulation experiments, the authors conduct in-depth research on the characteristics of water-bearing media and their mechanism of action, and explored the relevance of "Karst morphology", "Karst groundwater" and "fractal characteristics". An evaluation model of Karst development degree based on hydrochemical kinetic parameters and fractal index of Karst morphology is established. Based on the combination of Karst groundwater dynamics, hydrochemistry, water-rock interaction theory and fractal theory, the hydrochemical Kinetics and fractal index evaluation technique for Karst development is proposed. It provides a new theory and method for improving the accuracy of Karst and groundwater forecasting. The research results are of practical and guiding significance to the construction, Karst geological disasters prevention and management of various underground projects in Karst areas. Engineers and technicians, hydrogeological engineering geologists, and college students engaged in tunnel and underground engineering will find it valuable.

__label__1, Hydrometeorology,Introduction to Hydrometeorology,,,Introduction to Hydrometeorology is the study of the hydrolic cycle, which is the circulation of water from the seas, into the atmosphere, and back to either land or sea. This book describes hydrometeorology or the application of meteorology to problems that pertain to hydrology, and then discusses the approach, through meteorology, to the solution of hydrologic problems. This text outlines observation methods on the subject and discusses the applications of hydrometeorology to problems encountered in the study of river and lake behaviors. Topics include precipitation, melting of ice, streamflows, lakes, evaporation, and evapotranspiration. The frequently used methods in analysis, such as employing statistics to hydrometereological problems, precipitation analysis, and streamflow routing are explained. This text also shows how extending streamflow records can be helpful in predicting the regime or course of a stream in the future. Records of seasonal and annual flow, flood runoff, peak discharge, as well as seasons of low flow and drought become useful tools in estimating the frequency and magnitude of streamflows. After which, the book discusses possible engineering designs in irrigation, storm sewers, and reservoirs. The text looks into the ways how human has influenced the hydrologic cycle through induced precipitation, melting of ice covers, and urbanization. Lastly, some climactic trends and cycles that bring about climate change and water resource development are discussed. This text can be used by students studying hydrology and those with meteorology majors. This book can also be read by meteorologists, environmentalists, and people working in general earth sciences.

The book highlights recent theoretical results on the dynamics of random wind-generated waves, on long-term wave statistics, and on beach planform evolution. A fresh approach is given to more traditional concepts. For example, new evidence from a recent series of small-scale field experiments is used to introduce some crucial topics like wave forces. Also, the book gives some worked examples for the design of offshore or coastal structures. An exciting subject dealt with in the book is the quasi-deterministic mechanics of three-dimensional wave groups in sea storms, and the loads exerted by these wave groups on offshore structures. The text is intended for researchers and graduate students in ocean engineering, but may also be understood by undergraduates. The more complex concepts are explained with examples or more extensive case studies.

Provides an up-to-date, systematic, and comprehensive overview of all unconventional hydrocarbons Reorganizes and updates more than half of the first edition content, including four new chapters Includes a glossary on unconventional petroleum types, including tight-sandstone oil and gas, coal-bed gas, shale gas, oil and gas in fissure-cave-type carbonate rocks, in volcanic reservoirs, and in metamorphic rocks, heavy crude oil and natural bitumen, and gas hydrates Presents new theories, new methods, new technologies, and new management methods, helping to meet the demands of technology development and production requirements in unconventional plays
__label__1, Limnology,Polar Lakes and Rivers,,,This is the first book to describe the ecology of high latitude lakes, rivers and glacial environments in both the North and South polar regions. From the lake-rich floodplains of the Arctic to the deep, enigmatic waters of Lake Vostok, Antarctica, these regions contain some of the most extraordinary aquatic ecosystems on Earth. They provide a fascinating diversity of habitats for plant, animal and microbial communities, and are proving to be valuable model systems for exploring many ecological themes including landscape-lake interactions, adaptation of life to environmental extremes, and controls on the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Some of these waters also have direct global implications, including permafrost thaw lakes as sources of greenhouse gases, subglacial aquatic environments as a storehouse of ancient microbes, and Arctic rivers as major inputs of freshwater and organic carbon to the World Ocean. Given that many polar areas are experiencing greater climate warming than at lower latitudes, these ecosystems can also be viewed as sentinels of global change. This timely volume brings together many of the world's leading researchers in polar limnology to describe these diverse aquatic environments and their ecology. It introduces each major ecosystem type, examines the similarities and differences between Arctic and Antarctic systems as well as their responses to environmental change, and describes new frontiers for future research. A glossary of terms is provided for non-specialists, and a set of colour plates introduces the ecosystems and their biota. Polar Lakes and Rivers will be of value to students and specialist researchers alike, as well as to those with a more general interest in aquatic ecology, polar environments or global change who require an authoritative overview of this fast emerging topic.

__label__1, Physics of the Earth's Interior,Deep interior of the earth,,,For those who do not research the deep Earth but who wish to appreciate the current state of our understanding...the book is extremely appropriate because it is clearly written succint and well illustrated... - Nature; If you want to know the present status of research questions and discoveries bearing on the earth's interior, this book is an excellent starting point. The book combines the best of a research monograph, or long review article, and a short introductory text. It is impressively up-to-date , yet is not overly encyclopedic. More important, it fairly summarizes current debates and controvesies, while clearly explaining the motivation behind the work leading to the conflicting views. - Journal of Geologic Education; There may by more than a few readers out there for whom the advances in deep earth geophysics are coming just a bit too fast to assimilate. If you are one of these, this is your book, in which a comprehensive update is joined with considered judgements about what will endure. - Geological Magazine; ...an extremely timely addition to the literature...an excellent overview suitable not only for a beginning graduate student...but a useful and inexpensive addition to the bookshelf of anyone with an interest in the earth's deep interior

__label__1, Planetary Geology,Planetary crusts,,,This is the first book ever published to explain how and why solid planets and satellites develop crusts. Written by two leading authorities on the subject, it presents a geochemical and geological survey of the crusts of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, the asteroid Vesta, and several satellites such as Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. After describing how solar system bodies are formed, the authors compare the different planetary crusts and discuss current controversies on the subject. They introduce the theory of stochastic processes dominating crustal development, and debate the possibility of Earth-like planets existing elsewhere in the cosmos. Extensively referenced and annotated, this book presents an up-to-date survey of the scientific problems of crustal development, and is a key reference for researchers and students in geology, geochemistry, planetary science, astrobiology, and astronomy.
__label__1, Comprehensive Space Physics,Physics of the space environment,,,This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the physical phenomena that result from the interaction of the sun and the planets - often termed space weather. Physics of the Space Environment explores the basic processes in the Sun, in the interplanetary medium, in the near-Earth space, and down into the atmosphere. The first part of the book summarizes fundamental elements of transport theory relevant for the atmosphere, ionosphere and the magnetosphere. This theory is then applied to physical phenomena in the space environment. The fundamental physical processes are emphasized throughout, and basic concepts and methods are derived from first principles. This book is unique in its balanced treatment of space plasma and aeronomical phenomena. Students and researchers with a basic mathematics and physics background will find this book invaluable in the study of phenomena in the space environment.

__label__1, Upper Atmospheric Physics,Dynamics in Atmospheric Physics,,,Motion is manifest in the atmosphere in an almost infinite variety of ways. In Dynamics in Atmospheric Physics, Dr. Richard Lindzen describes the nature of motion in the atmosphere, develops fluid dynamics relevant to the atmosphere, and explores the role of motion in determining the climate and atmospheric composition. The author presents the material in a lecture note style, and the emphasis throughout is on describing phenomena that are at the frontiers of current research, but due attention is given to the methodology of research and to the historical background of these topics. The author's treatment and choice of topics is didactic. Problems at the end of each chapter will help students assimilate the material. In general the discussions emphasize physical concepts, and throughout Dr. Lindzen makes a concerted effort to avoid the notion that dynamic meteorology is simply the derivation of equations and their subsequent solution. His desire is that interested students will delve further into solution details. The book is intended as a text for first year graduate students in the atmospheric sciences. Although the material in the book is self contained, a familiarity with differential equations is assumed; some background in fluid mechanics is helpful.

__label__1, Paleontology,Functional morphology in vertebrate paleontology,,,A crucial task for paleontologists and paleobiologists is the reconstruction of the appearance, movements, and behavior of extinct vertebrates from studies of their bones or other, more rarely preserved parts. A related issue is the boundary between the scientific evidence for reconstruction and the need to resort to imagination. In this book, sixteen paleontologists and biologists discuss these questions, review the current status of functional studies of extinct vertebrates in the context of similar work on living animals, and present a broad philosophical view of the subject's development within the framework of phylogenetic analysis. The authors describe and debate methods for making realistic inferences of function in fossil vertebrates, and present examples where we may be confident that our reconstructions are both detailed and accurate.

Of the five accompanying plates, three depict eleven stages of Quaternary paleogeographic change between 18,000 B.P. and 5,000 B.P.; one depicts the retreat of the ice from between 18,000 B.P. and the Recent; and another reviews the status of Quaternary geologic mapping in Canada, with an extensive bibliography on the back.

__label__1, Physical Oceanography,Stochastic Modelling in Physical Oceanography,,,The study of the ocean is almost as old as the history of mankind itself. When the first seafarers set out in their primitive ships they had to understand, as best they could, tides and currents, eddies and vortices, for lack of understanding often led to loss of live. These primitive oceanographers were, of course, primarily statisticians. They collected what empirical data they could, and passed it down, ini tially by word of mouth, to their descendants. Data collection continued throughout the millenia, and although data bases became larger, more re liable, and better codified, it was not really until surprisingly recently that mankind began to try to understand the physics behind these data, and, shortly afterwards, to attempt to model it. The basic modelling tool of physical oceanography is, today, the partial differential equation. Somehow, we all 'know" that if only we could find the right set of equations, with the right initial and boundary conditions, then we could solve the mysteries of ocean dynamics once and for all.

The book provides a broad, yet selective, treatment of the subject, covering virtually all aspects of space plasmas in the solar system. There are sections on the sun and solar wind, the magnetized and unmagnetized planets, and the fundamental process of space plasmas including shocks, plasma waves, ULF waves, wave-particle interactions, and auroral processes. In addition to emphasizing analysis, the authors also place importance on underlying phenomenology with extensive attention to observations.

The book provides the first global synthesis and integrated analysis of environmental drivers and quantitative rates of solute and sedimentary fluxes in cold environments, and the likely impact of projected climate change. The focus on largely undisturbed cold environments allows ongoing climate change effects to be detected and, moreover, distinguished from anthropogenic impacts. A novel approach for co-ordinated and integrative process geomorphic research is introduced to enable better comparison between studies. This highly topical and multidisciplinary book, which includes case studies covering Arctic, Antarctic, and alpine environments, will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in the fields of geomorphology, sedimentology and global environmental change.

__label__1, Precambrian Geology,Precambrian Ophiolites and Related Rocks,,,Recent developments have shown that many full and partial ophiolites are preserved in Precambrian cratons. This book provides a comprehensive description and discussion of the field aspects, geochemistry, geochronology and structure of the best of these ophiolites. It also presents syntheses of the characteristics of ophiolites of different ages, and an analysis of what the characteristics of these ophiolites mean for the thermal and chemical evolution of the earth.This title emphasizes new studies of Precambrian Geology that have documented ophiolites, ophiolitic fragments, and ophiolitic melanges in many Precambrian terranes. Each chapter focuses on individual Precambrian ophiolites or regions with numerous Precambrian ophiolites, and covers field aspects, petrology, geochemistry, geochronology, and other descriptive aspects of these ophiolites, it also delves into more theoretical and speculative aspects about the interpretation of the significance of these ancient ophiolites.

__label__1, Exploration Geophysics,Physical Properties of Rocks,,,The interpretation of geophysical data in exploration geophysics, well logging, engineering, mining and environmental geophysics requires knowledge of the physical properties of rocks and their correlations. Physical properties are a "key" for combined interpretation techniques. The study of rock physics provides an interdisciplinary treatment of physical properties, whether related to geophysical, geotechnical, hydrological or geological methodology. Physical Properties of Rocks,2nd Edition, describes the physical fundamentals of rock properties, based on typical experimental results and relevant theories and models. It provides readers with all relevant rock properties and their interrelationships in one concise volume. Furthermore, it guides the reader through experimental and theoretical knowledge in order to handle models and theories in practice. Throughout the book the author focuses on the problems of applied geophysics with respect to exploration and the expanding field of applications in engineering and mining geophysics, geotechnics, hydrology and environmental problems, and the properties under the conditions of the upper Earth crust.Physical Properties of Rocks, Second Edition, guides readers through a systematic presentation of all relevant physical properties and their interrelationships in parallel with experimental and theoretical basic knowledge and a guide for handling core models and theories

__label__1, Disaster Geography,Building Community Disaster Resilience Through Private-Public Collaboration,,,Natural disasters--including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods--caused more than 220,000 deaths worldwide in the first half of 2010 and wreaked havoc on homes, buildings, and the environment. To withstand and recover from natural and human-caused disasters, it is essential that citizens and communities work together to anticipate threats, limit their effects, and rapidly restore functionality after a crisis. Increasing evidence indicates that collaboration between the private and public sectors could improve the ability of a community to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. Several previous National Research Council reports have identified specific examples of the private and public sectors working cooperatively to reduce the effects of a disaster by implementing building codes, retrofitting buildings, improving community education, or issuing extreme-weather warnings. State and federal governments have acknowledged the importance of collaboration between private and public organizations to develop planning for disaster preparedness and response. Despite growing ad hoc experience across the country, there is currently no comprehensive framework to guide private-public collaboration focused on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. Building Community Disaster Resilience through Private-Public Collaboration assesses the current state of private-public sector collaboration dedicated to strengthening community resilience, identifies gaps in knowledge and practice, and recommends research that could be targeted for investment. Specifically, the book finds that local-level private-public collaboration is essential to the development of community resilience. Sustainable and effective resilience-focused private-public collaboration is dependent on several basic principles that increase communication among all sectors of the community, incorporate flexibility into collaborative networks, and encourage regular reassessment of collaborative missions, goals, and practices.

__label__1, Geographic Information Science,Foundations of Geographic Information Science,,,As the use of geographical information systems develops apace, a significant strand of research activity is being directed to the fundamental nature of geographic information. This volume contains a collection of essays and discussions on this theme. What is geographic information? What fundamental principles are associated with it? How can it be represented? How does it represent the world? How can geographic information be quantified? How can it be communicated and related to the other information sciences? How does HCI tie in with it? A number of other more specific but relevant issues are considered, such as Spatio-temporal relationships, boundaries, granularity and taxonomy.This book is a revised and updated version of a collection of presentations given by a group of distinguished researchers in the field of Geographic Information Science who gathered in Manchester in July 2001. It should be useful for graduate students as well as researchers and high-level professionals.

The book brings together fundamental results developed by the Russian mathematical school in regularization theory and combines them with the related research in geophysical inversion carried out in the West. It presents a detailed exposition of the methods of regularized solution of inverse problems based on the ideas of Tikhonov regularization, and shows the different forms of their applications in both linear and nonlinear methods of geophysical inversion. This text is the first to treat many kinds of inversion and imaging techniques in a unified mathematical manner.The book is divided in five parts covering the foundations of the inversion theory and its applications to the solution of different geophysical inverse problems, including potential field, electromagnetic, and seismic methods. The first part is an introduction to inversion theory. The second part contains a description of the basic methods of solution of the linear and nonlinear inverse problems using regularization. The following parts treat the application of regularization methods in gravity and magnetic, electromagnetic, and seismic inverse problems.

__label__1, Planetary Geology,Planet earth,,,The next few decades are likely to witness deep environmental crises, crises we will be able to cope with only through a clear understanding of the complex, delicate system of which we are part. Fortunately, the great advances made in all fields of science since World War II make it possible to reconstruct the entire life history of the world we live in, from the Big Bang to the present, and thus to understand how the system works. This book presents a global picture of our world - how it originated, how it evolved, how it works - and provides the background necessary to assess ways to stabilize it. Although the science is rigorous and quantitative, the book is written in an informal style and is readily accessible to anyone with a knowledge of high-school algebra.
__label__1, Marine Geology,Antarctic Marine Geology,,,The fragile Antarctic environment consists of a closely linked system of the lithosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. Changes in this system have influenced global climate, oceanography and sea level for most of Cenozoic time. The geological history of this region therefore provides a special record of important interactions among the various components of the Earth System. Antarctic Marine Geology is the first comprehensive single-authored book to introduce students and researchers to the geological history of the region and the unique processes that occur there. Research literature on the region is widely disseminated, and until now no single reference has existed that provides such a summary. The book is intended as a reference for all scientists working in Antarctica, and will also serve as a textbook for graduate courses in Antarctic marine geology.,

__label__1, Geomorphology,Tectonic Geomorphology,,,Tectonic geomorphology is the study of the interplay between tectonic and surface processes that shape the landscape in regions of active deformation. Recent advances in the quantification of rates and physical basis of tectonic and surface processes have rejuvenated the field of tectonic geomorphology. Modern tectonic geomorphology is an exciting and highly integrative field which utilizes techniques and data derived from studies of geomorphology, seismology, geochronology, structure, geodesy, and Quaternary climate change. While emphasizing new insights from the last decade of research, Tectonic Geomorphology reviews the fundamentals of the subject which include the nature of faulting and folding, the creation and use of geomorphic markers for tracing deformation, chronological techniques which date deformation, geodetic techniques for defining recent deformation, and paleoseismologic approaches to calibrate past deformation. The overall focus of this book is on new interpretations of landform evolution and insights on the interplay between surface processes and tectonics that emerge from integrative studies. The authors have developed an up-to-date interpretation of landscapes in tectonically active environments for upper-level undergraduate and graduate earth science students and practicing geologists.

__label__1, Seismology,Theoretical Global Seismology,,,After every major earthquake, the Earth rings like a bell for several days. These free oscillations of the Earth and the related propagating body and surface waves are routinely detected at broad-band seismographic stations around the world. In this book, F. A. Dahlen and Jeroen Tromp present an advanced theoretical treatment of global seismology, describing the normal-mode, body-wave, and surface-wave methods employed in the determination of the Earth's three-dimensional internal structure and the source mechanisms of earthquakes. The authors provide a survey of both the history of global seismological research and the major theoretical and observational advances made in the past decade.   The book is divided into three parts. In the first, "Foundations," Dahlen and Tromp give an extensive introduction to continuum mechanics and discuss the representation of seismic sources and the free oscillations of a completely general Earth model. The resulting theory should provide the basis for future scientific discussions of the elastic-gravitational deformation of the Earth. The second part, "The Spherical Earth," is devoted to the free oscillations of a spherically symmetric Earth. In the third part, "The Aspherical Earth," the authors discuss methods of dealing with the Earth's three-dimensional heterogeneity. The book is concerned primarily with the forward problem of global seismology--detailing how synthetic seismograms and spectra may be calculated and interpreted.   As a long-needed unification of theories in global seismology, the book will be important to graduate students and to professional seismologists, geodynamicists, and geomagnetists, as well as to astronomers who study the free oscillations of the Sun and other stars.

__label__1, Geomorphology,Introduction to Coastal Processes and Geomorphology, Second Edition,,,The world's coastlines represent a myriad of dynamic and constantly changing environments. Heavily settled and intensely used areas, they are of enormous importance to humans and understanding how they are shaped and change is crucial to our future.  Introduction to Coastal Processes and Geomorphologybegins by discussing coastal systems and shows how these systems link to the processes examined in detail throughout the book. These include the morphodynamic paradigm, tides, waves and sediment transport. Later chapters explore fluvial deltas, estuaries, beaches and barriers, coastal sand dunes and geologically-influenced coasts such as cliffs, coral reefs and atolls.  A new chapter addresses the forward-facing aspect of coastal morphodynamics, including the ways in which coasts respond to rapid climate changes such as present day global warming. Also new to this second edition is a chapter on future coasts which considers the wider effects of coastal change on other important aspects of coastal systems, including ecology, management, socio-cultural activities, built and natural heritage, and archaeology.  Case studies using examples from around the world illustrate theory in practice and bring the subject to life. Each chapter starts by outlining the 'aims' and questions at the end allow you to track your progress.
__label__1, Hydrophysics,Climate Change Impacts on Freshwater Ecosystems,,,This text examines the impact of climate change on freshwater ecosystems, past, present and future. It especially considers the interactions between climate change and other drivers of change including hydromorphological modification, nutrient loading, acid deposition and contamination by toxic substances using evidence from palaeolimnology, time-series analysis, space-for-time substitution, laboratory and field experiments and process modelling. The book evaluates these processes in relation to extreme events, seasonal changes in ecosystems, trends over decadal-scale time periods, mitigation strategies and ecosystem recovery.The book is also concerned with how aspects of hydrophysical, hydrochemical and ecological change can be used as early indicators of climate change in aquatic ecosystems and it addresses the implications of future climate change for freshwater ecosystem management at the catchment scale.This is an ideal book for the scientific research community, but is also accessible to Masters and senior undergraduate students.

As a comprehensive geography textbook, it consists of detailed research methodology for research in human geography including a few selected case studies in Asia. It explores different approaches, methodological possibilities, and challenges in conducting geographical research in human geography. New digital geographic data sources and GIS applications can help researchers to receive clearer concepts and obtain better measurements of the relevant attributes changes. Furthermore, the book provides an opportunity to critically examine the conceptualization and identification of the field in geographical research and how digital media has not only expanded the scope of what constitutes the field but has redefined the field in itself as well as the practices of observing, knowing, and analyzing the real world. The uniqueness of this book is due to the contribution of several professors and subject experts from South East and East Asia with special particular reference to cases studies from this region of the world.

__label__1, Remote Sensing Oceanography,Remote Sensing in Applications of Geoinformation,,,Remote sensing, especially from satellites, is a source of invaluable data which can be used to generate synoptic information for virtually all parts of the Earth, including the atmosphere, land, and ocean. In the last few decades, such data have evolved as a basis for accurate information about the Earth, leading to a wealth of geoscientific analysis focusing on diverse applications. Geoinformation systems based on remote sensing are increasingly becoming an integral part of the current information and communication society. The integration of remote sensing and geoinformation essentially involves combining data provided from both, in a consistent and sensible manner. This process has been accelerated by technologically advanced tools and methods for remote sensing data access and integration, paving the way for scientific advances in a broadening range of remote sensing exploitations in applications of geoinformation. This volume hosts original research focusing on the exploitation of remote sensing in applications of geoinformation. The emphasis is on a wide range of applications, such as the mapping of soil nutrients, detection of plastic litter in oceans, urban microclimate, seafloor morphology, urban forest ecosystems, real estate appraisal, inundation mapping, and solar potential analysis.

__label__1, Planetary Atmosphere,Atmospheres and Ionospheres of the Outer Planets and their Satellites,,,One of the most fundamental discoveries of the solar system was the detection of four moons in orbit around Jupiter by Galileo Galilei in 1610. The discovery was significant not only in the context of Jupiter; it gave credence to and was instrumental in firmly establishing the heliocentric system of Nicolaus Copernicus. Almost four centuries after Galileo's discovery, exten sive observations by the two Voyager spacecrafts have once again revolu tionized our thinking about the major planets, their composition, structure, origin, and evolution. This book is an attempt at summarizing our present understanding of the atmospheres and ionospheres in the outer solar system, with particular emphasis on the relevant physics and chemistry. I was motivat ed to prepare this manuscript for the following reasons. First, after under going rapid expansion in the recent past, the subject has finally attained suf ficient maturity to warrant a monograph of its own. Second, I have felt that as a result of recent observations, new and challenging problems have arisen whose resolution requires unconventional analysis and theoretical interpreta tion of existing data, as well as the collection of new kinds of data. I believe the time is ripe to put these issues in the appropriate scientific perspective, with the hope of stimulating novel theoretical, observational, and laboratory studies. I have highlighted the significant scientific problems throughout the book, especially at the end of each chapter.

__label__1, Physical Oceanography,Physical Oceanography of the Dying Aral Sea,,,Physical Oceanography of the Dying Aral Sea describes the background, present crisis state, and possible future of this peculiar inland water body from the physical oceanographic standpoint. Based on a wide range of material, a large part of which was published in Russian and has not been previously available to the international reader, the book first provides an historical overview of this unique system, which possesses both lake and sea properties. Next, the current physical state of the lake is described, partly based on original field research and model experiments, along with the remote sensing data, model results and analyses extracted from recent literature. Next, book attempts to forecast the forthcoming state of the Aral Sea and identify plausible future scenarios. Finally, the book discusses the Aral Sea dessication viewd as a part of the global perspective.

Topics include surface weathering, fluvial processes, environmental pollution, oceanography and paleoceanography, sedimentary mineral diagenesis and radiometric dating, thus bridging the gap between processes acting on the Earth today and the geological record. Extensive use is made of carefully selected case studies, both pioneering and state-of-the-art. This book enables the reader to critically assess previous work from the literature as well as encouraging already established researchers to apply the most modern isotopic approaches to their particular field of study.

__label__1, Physical Oceanography,The Physical Oceanography of Sea Straits,,,Suppose one were given the task of mapping the general circulation in an unfamiliar ocean. The ocean, like our own, is subdivided into basins and marginal seas interconnected by sea straits. Assuming a limited budget for this undertaking, one would do well to choose the straits as observational starting points. To begin with, the currents flowing from one basin to the next, over possibly wide and time-varying paths, are confined to narrow and stable routes within the straits. Mass, heat and chemical budgets for individual basins can be formulated in terms of the fluxes measured across the straits using a relatively small number of instruments. The confinement of the flow by a strait can also give rise to profound dynamical conse quences including choking or hydraulic control, a process similar to that by which a dam regulates the flow from a reservoir. The funneling geometry can lead to enhanced tidal modulation and increased velocities, giving rise to local instabilities, mixing, internal bores, jumps, and other striking hydraulic and fine scale phenomena. In short, sea straits repre sent choke points which are observationally and dynamically strategic and which contain a full range of fascinating physical processes.

__label__1, Ionospheric Physics,Ionospheric Effects of Solar Flares,,,Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances resulting from an interaction of the Solar Flare radiation with the constituents of the upper atmosphere constitute one of the three major aspects of ground level monitoring of solar flares -the other two being optical observations of flares, and the observations of solar bursts in radio wavelengths. SIDs, therefore, form a major part of flare monitoring programme in many observatories. Unlike the other two, however, the ionospheric effects of flares provide one major additional source of interest - the reaction of the ionospheric plasma to an impulsive ionization. The high atmosphere provides a low pressure laboratory without walls in which a host of reactions occur between electrons, ions and neutral particles. The resulting products and their distributions may bear no resemblance to those of the primary neutral constituents or their direct ionization products. The variations with the time of the day, with season and with solar activity that form the bulk of the ionospheric measurements are too slow to allow any insight into the nature of these ionospheric reactions whose lifetimes are often very short. The relaxation time of the ionospheric ionization is only a few minutes or fraction of a minute in the lower ionosphere and in the E-region and is about 30 min to an hour at 300 km. The flares provide a sudden short impulse comparable to these time scales.

__label__1, Exploration Geochemistry,Gold metallogeny and exploration,,chemistry, deposits, distribution, geology, gold, inorganic chemistry, iron, metals, economic geology,Within the last decade, the high and continuing demand for gold has prompted a global gold rush on a scale never before seen, not even in the heady days of Ballarat, California and the Yukon. Gold is being sought on every continent and, with very few exceptions, in every country around the world. Such interest and fierce competition has demanded considerable innovation and improvement in exploration techniques paralleled by a rapid expansion of the geological database and consequent genetic modelling for the many different types of gold deposits now recognized. This proliferation of data has swamped the literature and left explorationist and academic alike unable to sift more than a small proportion of the accumulating information. This new book represents an attempt to address this major problem by providing succinct syntheses of all major aspects of gold metallogeny and exploration, ranging from the chemical distribution of gold in the Earth's crust, and the hydrothermal chemistry of gold, to Archaean and Phanerozoic lode deposits, epithermal environments, chemical sediments, and placer deposits, and culminates in chapters devoted to geochemical and geophysical exploration, and the economics of gold deposits. Each chapter is written by geoscientists who are acknowledged internationally in their respective fields, thus guaranteeing a broad yet up-to-date coverage. In addition, each chapter is accompanied by reference lists which provide readers with access to the most pertinent and useful publications.

__label__1, Paleogeography,The Trace-Fossil Record of Major Evolutionary Events,,,This volume addresses major evolutionary changes that took place during the Ediacaran and the Paleozoic. These include discussions on the nature of Ediacaran ecosystems, as well as the ichnologic signature of evolutionary radiations, such as the Cambrian explosion and the Great Ordovician biodiversification event, the invasion of the land, and the end-Permian mass extinction.  This volume set provides innovative reviews of the major evolutionary events in the history of life from an ichnologic perspective. Because the long temporal range of trace fossils has been commonly emphasized, biogenic structures have been traditionally overlooked in macroevolution. However, comparisons of ichnofaunas through geologic time do reveal the changing ecology of organism-substrate interactions. The use of trace fossils in evolutionary paleoecology represents a new trend that is opening a window for our understanding of major evolutionary radiations and mass extinctions. Trace fossils provide crucial evidence for the recognition of spatial and temporal patterns and processes associated with paleoecologic breakthroughs.

__label__1, Comprehensive Solid Earth Physics,An introduction to seismology, earthquakes, and earth structure,,,An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes and Earth Structures is an introduction to seismology and its role in the earth sciences, and is written for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.The fundamentals of seismic wave propagation are developed using a physical approach and then applied to show how refraction, reflection, and teleseismic techniques are used to study the structure and thus the composition and evolution of the earth. The book shows how seismic waves are used to study earthquakes and are integrated with other data to investigate the plate tectonic processes that cause earthquakes. Figures, examples, problems, and computer exercises teach students about seismology in a creative and intuitive manner. Necessary mathematical tools including vector and tensor analysis, matrix algebra, Fourier analysis, statistics of errors, signal processing, and data inversion are introduced with many relevant examples. The text also addresses the fundamentals of seismometry and applications of seismology to societal issues. Special attention is paid to help students visualize connections between different topics and view seismology as an integrated science.An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes, and Earth Structure gives an excellent overview for students of geophysics and tectonics, and provides a strong foundation for further studies in seismology.

__label__1, Planetary Geology,Introduction to planetary geomorphology,,,Nearly all major planets and moons in our Solar System have been visited by spacecraft and the data they have returned has revealed the incredible diversity of planetary surfaces. Featuring a wealth of images, this textbook explores the geological evolution of the planets and moons. Introductory chapters discuss how information gathered from spacecraft is used to unravel the geological complexities of our Solar System. Subsequent chapters focus on current understandings of planetary systems. The textbook shows how planetary images and remote sensing data are analyzed through the application of fundamental geological principles. It draws on results from spacecraft sent throughout the Solar System by NASA and other space agencies. Aimed at undergraduate students in planetary geology, geoscience, astronomy and solar system science, it highlights the differences and similarities of the surfaces at a level that can be readily understood by non-specialists
__label__1, Marine Physics,Stochastic Dynamics of Marine Structures,,,Stochastic Dynamics of Marine Structures is a text for students and a reference for professionals on the basic theory and methods used for stochastic modelling and analysis of marine structures subjected to environmental loads. The first part of the book provides a detailed introduction to the basic dynamic analysis of structures, serving as a foundation for later chapters on stochastic response analysis. This includes an extensive chapter on the finite element method. A careful introduction to stochastic modelling is provided, which includes such concepts as stochastic process, variance spectrum, random environmental processes, response spectrum, response statistics and short- and long-term extreme value models. The second part of the book offers detailed discussion of limit state design approaches, fatigue design methods, the equations of motion for dynamic structures and numerical solution techniques. The final chapter highlights methods for prediction of extreme values from measured data or data obtained by Monte Carlo simulation.

__label__1, Surface Geochemistry,A Manual of Marine Meteorology for Apprentices and Officers of the World's Merchant Navies,,,WE gladly give a word of welcome to this little book, written as it is by a sailor with the view of winning an increase of interest in the subject of meteorology from members of his own profession. The author knows well those for whom he is writing, so that while he has kept his book free from pedantry, he has managed to fill it with practical information and to endow it with the spirit of earnest purpose. The encouragement of a more complete survey of the complicated phenomena manifested, not only in our atmosphere, but in the ocean itself, is highly commendable, and we should imagine the author well qualified by knowledge and experience to interest the class to whom he mainly addresses himself. For he has sailed every ocean in all sorts of weather, and having himself to some extent profited by the systematised experience of others, he seeks now to widen and complete the circle of observation, so that those who come after may have still more trustworthy sources of guidance and readier means for escaping the perilous chances of navigation.

__label__1, Paleogeography,Earth History and Palaeogeography,,,Using full-colour palaeogeographical maps from the Cambrian to the present, this interdisciplinary volume explains how plate motions and surface volcanism are linked to processes in the Earth's mantle, and to climate change and the evolution of the Earth's biota. These new and very detailed maps provide a complete and integrated Phanerozoic story of palaeogeography. They illustrate the development of all the major mountain-building orogenies. Old lands, seas, ice caps, volcanic regions, reefs, and coal beds are highlighted on the maps, as well as faunal and floral provinces. Many other original diagrams show sections from the Earth's core, through the mantle, and up to the lithosphere, and how Large Igneous Provinces are generated, helping to understand how plates have appeared, moved, and vanished through time. Supplementary resources are available online, making this an invaluable reference for researchers, graduate students, professional geoscientists and anyone interested in the geological history of the Earth.
__label__1, Planetary Geology,Planetary geoscience,,,For many years, planetary science has been taught as part of the astronomy curriculum, from a very physics-based perspective, and from the framework of a tour of the Solar System - body by body. Over the past decades, however, spacecraft exploration and related laboratory research on extraterrestrial materials have given us a new understanding of planets and how they are shaped by geological processes. Based on a course taught at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, this is the first textbook to focus on geologic processes, adopting a comparative approach that demonstrates the similarities and differences between planets, and the reasons for these. Profusely illustrated, and with a wealth of pedagogical features, this book provides an ideal capstone course for geoscience majors - bringing together aspects of mineralogy, petrology, geochemistry, volcanology, sedimentology, geomorphology, tectonics, geophysics and remote sensing.

__label__1, Remote Sensing Oceanography,Simulation of the Sea Surface for Remote Sensing,,,This book considers the formation of the signal reflected from the sea surface when sensing in the radio and optical range. Currently, remote sensing from space is the main source of information about the processes taking place in the atmosphere and ocean. The correct interpretation of remote sensing data requires detailed information about the rough surface that forms the reflected signal. The first three chapters describe the statistical and spatial-temporal characteristics of the sea surface, focusing on the effects associated with the nonlinearity of sea surface waves. The analysis makes extensive use of data obtained by the authors on a stationary oceanographic platform located on the Black sea. In the next seven chapters, the authors analyze how the nonlinearity of waves affects the formation of a signal reflected from the sea surface. This book is geared for advanced level research in the general subject area of remote sensing and modeling as they apply to the coastal marine environment. It is of value to scientists and engineers involved in the development of methods and instruments of remote sensing, analysis and interpretation of data. It is useful for students who have decided to devote themselves to the study of the oceans.

Written in an engaging and informative style, Dynamic Paleontology outlines the best application of quantitative and other tools to critical problems in the paleontological sciences including such topics as analysis of the Cambrian Explosion and the question regarding the presence of life on Mars. The book considers how we think about certain types questions and shows how we can refine our approach to analysis right from the beginning of any particular research effort. The analytical tools presented here will have wide application to other fields of knowledge; as such the book represents a major contribution to our deployment of modern scientific method.

In some fields such as ore deposit studies, stable isotopes have played an integral part for many years; in others such as environmental studies the application of stable isotopes is still growing. In recent years new microanalytical techniques, permitting relatively precise analysis of very small sample sizes, have opened up exciting research avenues which will allow the investigation of a new generation of problems.

The purpose of the book is to present an introduction to and an overview of the broad field of hydrography. Since there is only a weak interdependence between the eleven chapters, each of them can be studied separately. When used for a course, it is therefore also possible to consider only a selected number of chapters.

__label__1, Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics,An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology,,Cloud Fog Meteorology Profil Wind convection morphology temperature air pollution and air quality,Part of the excitement in boundary-layer meteorology is the challenge associated with turbulent flow - one of the unsolved problems in classical physics. An additional attraction of the filed is the rich diversity of topics and research methods that are collected under the umbrella-term of boundary-layer meteorology. The flavor of the challenges and the excitement associated with the study of the atmospheric boundary layer are captured in this textbook. Fundamental concepts and mathematics are presented prior to their use, physical interpretations of the terms in equations are given, sample data are shown, examples are solved, and exercises are included. The work should also be considered as a major reference and as a review of the literature, since it includes tables of parameterizatlons, procedures, filed experiments, useful constants, and graphs of various phenomena under a variety of conditions. It is assumed that the work will be used at the beginning graduate level for students with an undergraduate background in meteorology, but the author envisions, and has catered for, a heterogeneity in the background and experience of his readers.

__label__1, Upper Atmospheric Physics,Physics and Chemistry of Upper Atmosphere,,,This book contains the lecmres presented at the Summer Advanced Study Institute, 'Physics and Chemistry of Upper Atmospheres' which was held at the University of Orleans, Orleans, France, during the period July 31 through August 11,1972. One hundred thirty nine persons from 14 different countries attended the Institute. The authors and the publisher have made a special effort for rapid publication of an up-to-date status of the particles, fields, and processes in the earth's magnetosphere, which is an ever changing area. Special thanks are due to the lecturers for their diligent preparation and excellent presentations. The individual lectures and the published papers were deliberately limited; the authors' cooperation in conforming to these specifications is greatly appreciated. The contents of the book are organized by sub ject area rather than in the order in which papers were presented during the Institute. Many thanks are due to Warren Berning, Donald M. Hunten, Edward Llewellyn, J. Ortner, Henry Rishbeth, Harold I Schiff, Lance Thomas, Alister Vallance Jones, and Gilbert Weill, who served as session chairmen during the Institute and contributed greatly to its success by skillfully directing the discussion period in a stimulating manner after each lecture.

__label__1, Hydrometry,Aridity Trend In Northern China,,Environmental Science,The continued aridity trend occurring in many regions worldwide is a manifestation of the response of the earth system to global change. It hinders severely the sustainable development of these regions. Northern China is one of the largest and most affected regions in the world. This book documents the climate change in its arid and semi-arid areas on decadal to geological time scales based on analyses of various data sources. These analyses improved our understanding of the potential mechanisms driving the aridity trend, particularly in the second half of the 20th century. Based on these analyses and a systematic assessment of the impact of the aridity trend on the ecological and hydrological processes in northern China, measures of human adaptation to the aridity trend for socio-economic developments are proposed.World Scientific Series on Asia-Pacific Weather and Climate is indexed in SCOPUS.

__label__0, Southwest Airlines is the indisputable leader of the Low-Cost Airline industry in the United States. A product of deregulation, the expansion of its unique business model has been responsible for the substantial real price declines in consumer airfares since the 1980s. However, recent fuel price declines have had a significant impact on the industry and their impact on the low-cost sector today, as the driver of price competition, is important to understand. This paper includes a multivariate linear regression of 2015 data to examine the impact of various US LCCs on average airport, airport-route, and city-route fares, and compares the impacts to the results of ticket data from 2012 and 2007, with a particular interest in the effect of Southwest. It concludes that despite industry concentration, the association of Southwest with lower average route, airport, and market prices had actually strengthened from 2012 to 2015.
__label__0, T HE STUDY OF homograft heart valves was greatly stimulated in 1962, when Kerwin et al.1 demonstrated function of a cadaver aortic valve which had been placed, seven years before, in a patient's descending thoracic aorta.2 Duran and Gunning3 demonstrated the feasibility of using aortic valve homografts in the normal subcoronary position, and clinical trials have been reported by Ross4 and by Barratt-Boyes,5 with good early functional results. Despite the efforts of these few interested groups, general acceptance of the use of homograft valves has been delayed because their fate is not yet predictable. Characteristics which require assessment include the durability of homograft tissue, resistance to endocarditis and thrombosis, the effects of homograft rejection, the potential of replacement by autologous cells, and the possible ongrowth of fibrous tissue from the base similar to that which produced rigidity of synthetic prosthetic leaflets. The optimum manner of valve preparation and storage needs further appraisal to determine the effect on ultimate durability and the other characteristics mentioned above. Replacement of canine pulmonic, mitral, and aortic valves with homologous valves has been performed in this laboratory over the past six years in an effort to answer some of these questions.
__label__0, A 67-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of fatigue and fever. He had undergone heart transplantation 6 years earlier for idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He reported no weight loss, night sweats, or chills. He also reported no headache, rash, joint swelling, dysuria, or abdominal or respiratory problems.
__label__0, Current peer-to-peer file-sharing systems mostly work on wired networks. Mobile ad hoc network is characterized as multihop wireless communications between mobile devices. Five routing approaches with different complexity are proposed to enable peer-to-peer file-sharing over mobile ad hoc networks. The complexity of the proposed approaches is evaluated and compared. It is concluded that the cross-layer protocols perform better than simply overlaying peer-to-peer searching protocol on mobile ad hoc networks.
__label__0, Protecting data from malicious computer users continues to grow in importance. Whether preventing unauthorized access to personal photographs, ensuring compliance with federal regulations, or ensuring the integrity of corporate secrets, all applications require increased security to protect data from talented intruders. Specifically, as more and more files are preserved on disk the requirement to provide secure storage has increased in importance. This paper presents a survey of techniques for securely storing data, including theoretical approaches, prototype systems, and existing systems currently available. Due to the wide variety of potential solutions available and the variety of techniques to arrive at a particular solution, it is important to review the entire field prior to selecting an implementation that satisfies particular requirements. This paper provides an overview of the prominent characteristics of several systems to provide a foundation for making an informed decision. Initially, the paper establishes a set of criteria for evaluating a storage solution based on confidentiality, integrity, availability, and performance. Then, using these criteria, the paper explains the relevant characteristics of select storage systems and provides a comparison of the major differences.
__label__0, This article reviews lectins of animal and plant origin that induce apoptosis and autophagy of cancer cells and hence possess the potential of being developed into anticancer drugs. Apoptosis-inducing lectins encompass galectins, C-type lectins, annexins, Haliotis discus discus lectin, Polygonatum odoratum lectin, mistletoe lectin, and concanavalin A, fucose-binding Dicentrarchus labrax lectin, and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus lectin, Polygonatum odoratum lectin, and mistletoe lectin, Polygonatum odoratum lectin, autophagy inducing lectins include annexins and Polygonatum odoratum lectin.
__label__0, One of the key concepts in testing is that of adequate test sets. A test selection criterion decides which test sets are adequate. In this paper, a language schema for specifying a large class of test selection criteria is developed; the schema is based on two operations for building complex criteria from simple ones. Basic algebraic properties of the two operations are derived.  In the second part of the paper, a simple language-an instance of the general schema-is studied in detail, with the goal of generating small adequate test sets automatically. It is shown that one version of the problem is intractable, while another is solvable by an efficient algorithm. An implementation of the algorithm is described.
__label__0, Cluster analysis often serves as the initial step in the process of data classification. In this paper, the problem of clustering different length input data is considered. The edit distance as the minimum number of elementary edit operations needed to transform one vector into another is used. A heuristic for clustering unequal length vectors, analogue to the well known k-means algorithm is described and analyzed. This heuristic determines cluster centroids expanding shorter vectors to the lengths of the longest ones in each cluster in a specific way. It is shown that the time and space complexities of the heuristic are linear in the number of input vectors. Experimental results on real data originating from a system for classification of Web attacks are given.
__label__0, In this paper we present a new approach for marker less human motion capture from conventional camera feeds. The aim of our study is to recover 3D positions of key points of the body that can serve for gait analysis. Our approach is based on foreground segmentation, an articulated body model and particle filters. In order to be generic and simple no restrictive dynamic modelling was used. A new modified particle filtering algorithm was introduced. It is used efficiently to search the model configuration space. This new algorithm which we call interval particle filtering reorganizes the configurations search space in an optimal deterministic way and proved to be efficient in tracking natural human movement. Results for human motion capture from a single camera are presented and compared to results obtained from a marker based system. The system proved to be able to track motion successfully even in partial occlusions
__label__0, In this paper, we present an analytical tool for understanding the performance of structured overlay networks under churn based on the master-equation approach of physics. We motivate and derive an equation for the average number of hops taken by lookups during churn, for the chord network. We analyse this equation in detail to understand the behaviour with and without churn. We then use this understanding to predict how lookups will scale for varying peer population as well as varying the sizes of the routing tables. We also consider a change in the maintenance algorithm of the overlay, from periodic stabilisation to a reactive one which corrects fingers only when a change is detected. We generalise our earlier analysis to understand how the reactive strategy compares with the periodic one.
__label__0, This paper elaborates on the design of a machine translation evaluation method that aims to determine to what degree the meaning of an original text is preserved in translation, without looking into the grammatical correctness of its constituent sentences. The basic idea is to have a human evaluator take the sentences of the translated text and, for each of these sentences, determine the semantic relationship that exists between it and the sentence immediately preceding it. In order to minimise evaluator dependence, relations between sentences are expressed in terms of the conjuncts that can connect them, rather than through explicit categories. For an n-sentence text this results in a list of n-1 sentence-to-sentence relationships, which we call the text's connectivity profile. This can then be compared to the connectivity profile of the original text, and the degree of correspondence between the two would be a measure for the quality of the translation.A set of "essential" conjuncts was extracted for English and Japanese, and a computer interface was designed to support the task of inserting the most fitting conjuncts between sentence pairs. With these in place, several sets of experiments were performed.
__label__0, Superregular matrices are a class of lower triangular Toeplitz matrices that arise in the context of constructing convolutional codes having a maximum distance profile. These matrices are characterized by the property that no submatrix has a zero determinant unless it is trivially zero due to the lower triangular structure. In this paper, we discuss how superregular matrices may be used to construct codes having a maximum distance profile. We also introduce group actions that preserve the superregularity property and present an upper bound on the minimum size a finite field must have in order that a superregular matrix of a given size can exist over that field.
__label__0, In this paper, we investigate the issue of vertical handoffs in heterogeneous wireless networks. A QoS-based vertical handoff scheme for WLAN and WiMAX interworking networks is proposed with aim to provide always best service to users. We also present a simple, yet efficient method to estimate the available bandwidth in WLAN and WiMAX networks to evaluate the real-time status of the overlay networks and make a handoff decision based on the information. By our proposal, a handoff process will not only be triggered by unaccepted signal strength but also by unsatisfied QoS parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can keep stations always be best connected with their QoS requirements met.
__label__0, We explain how to optimize finite-length LDPC codes for transmission over the binary erasure channel. Our approach relies on an analytic approximation of the erasure probability. This is in turn based on a finite-length scaling result to model large scale erasures and a union bound involving minimal stopping sets to take into account small error events. We show that the performances of optimized ensembles as observed in simulations are well described by our approximation. Although we only address the case of transmission over the binary erasure channel, our method should be applicable to a more general setting.
__label__0, Solutions to the coalition formation problem commonly assume agent rationality and, correspondingly, utility maximization. This in turn may prevent agents from making compromises. As shown in recent studies, compromise may facilitate coalition formation and increase agent utilities. In this study we leverage on those new results. We devise a novel coalition formation mechanism that enhances compromise. Our mechanism can utilize information on task dependencies to reduce formation complexity. Further, it works well with both cardinal and ordinal task values. Via experiments we show that the use of the suggested compromise-based coalition formation mechanism provides significant savings in the computation and communication complexity of coalition formation. Our results also show that when information on task dependencies is used, the complexity of coalition formation is further reduced. We demonstrate successful use of the mechanism for collaborative information filtering, where agents combine linguistic rules to analyze documents' contents.
__label__0, This paper presents an analytical model for the fading channel correlation in general scattering environments. In contrast to the existing correlation models, our new approach treats the scattering environment as non-separable and it is modeled using a bi-angular power distribution. The bi-angular power distribution is parameterized by the mean departure and arrival angles, angular spreads of the univariate angular power distributions at the transmitter and receiver apertures, and a third parameter, the covariance between transmit and receive angles which captures the statistical interdependency between angular power distributions at the transmitter and receiver apertures. When this third parameter is zero, this new model reduces to the well known "Kronecker" model. Using the proposed model, we show that Kronecker model is a good approximation to the actual channel when the scattering channel consists of a single scattering cluster. In the presence of multiple remote scattering clusters we show that Kronecker model over estimates the performance by artificially increasing the number of multipaths in the channel.
__label__0, Hallux valgus is a complex deformity of the first ray and forefoot that can be surgically treated using different procedures and osteotomies. Preoperative planning includes anteroposterior and lateral plain films. The effect of weight-bearing on the results of the standardized measurements is still the subject of debate. We evaluated the effect of weight-bearing on the results of measurements and decision making by expert evaluators. A total of 21 foot and ankle surgeons were given weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing anteroposterior plain foot films of patients with hallux valgus. They were asked to measure 3 standard angles and then to select the most appropriate procedure from a short list. Using a paired Student's t test, no difference in the angles measured nor in the procedures chosen was detected between the weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing films. Although it is generally accepted that decisions regarding the treatment of hallux valgus should be based on plain weight-bearing films, in the present study, we established that non-weight-bearing films can reliably be used to choose the surgical procedure.
__label__0, In this paper, the problem of pinning control for synchronization of complex dynamical networks is discussed. A cost function of the controlled network is defined by the feedback gain and the coupling strength of the network. An interesting result is that lower cost is achieved by the control scheme of pinning nodes with smaller degrees. Some rigorous mathematical analysis is presented for achieving lower cost in the synchronization of different star-shaped networks. Numerical simulations on some non-regular complex networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and various star-shaped networks are shown for verification and illustration.
__label__0, The LOCKSS digital preservation system collects content by crawling the web and preserves it in the format supplied by the publisher. Eventually, browsers will no longer understand that format. A process called format migration converts it to a newer format that the browsers do understand. The LOCKSS program has designed and tested an initial implementation of format migration for Web content that is transparent to readers, building on the content negotiation capabilities of HTTP.
__label__0, Predicate abstraction provides a powerful tool for verifying properties of infinite-state systems using a combination of a decision procedure for a subset of first-order logic and symbolic methods originally developed for finite-state model checking. We consider models containing first-order state variables, where the system state includes mutable functions and predicates. Such a model can describe systems containing arbitrarily large memories, buffers, and arrays of identical processes. We describe a form of predicate abstraction that constructs a formula over a set of universally quantified variables to describe invariant properties of the first-order state variables. We provide a formal justification of the soundness of our approach and describe how it has been used to verify several hardware and software designs, including a directory-based cache coherence protocol.
__label__0, Cooperative optimization is a new way for finding global optima of complicated functions of many variables. It has some important properties not possessed by any conventional optimization methods. It has been successfully applied in solving many large scale optimization problems in image processing, computer vision, and computational chemistry. This paper shows the application of this optimization principle in decoding LDPC codes, which is another hard combinatorial optimization problem. The cooperative optimization algorithm is much simpler in computation than the classical sum-product algorithm. Compared to the sum-product algorithm, our algorithm lowered the error floor more than one order of magnitude in decoding an experimental LDPC code for China's HDTV
__label__0, Shock physics experiments are often complicated and expensive. As a result, researchers are unable to conduct as many experiments as they would like - leading to sparse data sets. In this paper, Support Vector Machines for regression are applied to velocimetry data sets for shock damaged and melted tin metal. Some success at interpolating between data sets is achieved. Implications for future work are discussed.
__label__0, We describe how specialized database technology and data analysis methods were applied by the Swedish defense to help deal with the violation of Swedish marine territory by foreign submarine intruders during the Eighties and early Nineties. Among several approaches tried some yielded interesting information, although most of the key questions remain unanswered. We conclude with a survey of belief-function- and genetic-algorithm-based methods which were proposed to support interpretation of intelligence reports and prediction of future submarine positions, respectively.
__label__0, This paper introduces new methods based on exponential families for modeling the correlations between words in text and speech. While previous work assumed the effects of word co-occurrence statistics to be constant over a window of several hundred words, we show that their influence is nonstationary on a much smaller time scale. Empirical data drawn from English and Japanese text, as well as conversational speech, reveals that the "attraction" between words decays exponentially, while stylistic and syntactic contraints create a "repulsion" between words that discourages close co-occurrence. We show that these characteristics are well described by simple mixture models based on two-stage exponential distributions which can be trained using the EM algorithm. The resulting distance distributions can then be incorporated as penalizing features in an exponential language model.
__label__0, Document management software systems are having a wide audience at present. However, groupware as a term has a wide variety of possible definitions. Groupware classification attempt is made in this paper. Possible approaches to groupware are considered including document management, document control and mailing systems. Lattice theory and concept modelling are presented as a theoretical background for the systems in question. Current technologies in state-of-the-art document managenent software are discussed. Design and implementation aspects for user-friendly integrate enterprise systems are described. Results for a real system to be implemented are given. Perspectives of the field in question are discussed.
__label__0, Significant effort has been invested recently to accelerate handover operations in a next generation mobile Internet. Corresponding works for developing efficient mobile multicast management are emergent. Both problems simultaneously expose routing complexity between subsequent points of attachment as a characteristic parameter for handover performance in access networks. As continuous mobility handovers necessarily occur between access routers located in geographic vicinity, this paper investigates on the hypothesis that geographically adjacent edge networks attain a reduced network distances as compared to arbitrary Internet nodes. We therefore evaluate and analyze edge distance distributions in various regions for clustered IP ranges on their geographic location such as a city. We use traceroute to collect packet forwarding path and round-trip-time of each intermediate node to scan-wise derive an upper bound of the node distances. Results of different scanning origins are compared to obtain the best estimation of network distance of each pair. Our results are compared with corresponding analysis of CAIDA Skitter data, overall leading to fairly stable, reproducible edge distance distributions. As a first conclusion on expected impact on handover performance measures, our results indicate a general optimum for handover anticipation time in 802.11 networks of 25 ms.
__label__0, ABSTRACT Human tumor-derived soluble NKG2D sMIC paralyzes the immune system through multiple pathways. Targeting soluble MIC with a nonblocking sMIC-neutralizing anti-MIC antibody effectuated and revamped endogenous innate and adoptive antitumor responses. Therapy induced regression of primary tumors and eliminated metastasis in preclinical models.
__label__0, This article considers the problem of directing a family of fully actuated surface vessels to cooperatively follow a set of convex and closed orbits with a time-invariant reference orbital velocity and maintain attitude synchronization. A consensus-based adaptive control law under a bidirectional communication topology is proposed to estimate the reference orbital velocity so that the restriction that every vessel in the family must have access to the reference in the previous literature can be removed. The assumption of nonzero total linear speed of each vessel is removed by the use of potential function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
__label__0, Many physical theories like chaos theory are fundamentally concerned with the conceptual tension between determinism and randomness. Kolmogorov complexity can express randomness in determinism and gives an approach to formulate chaotic behavior.
__label__0, Special needs children with neurodevelopment disorders such as autism are often uncooperative and disruptive during routine hospitalization processes such as initiation of anesthesia and transfer to operating table. These patients are often manually restrained and lifted onto the operating table by healthcare staff after they are anaesthetized, placing these children at risk of fall injuries and hospital staff at risk of back injuries and physical injuries inflicted by these patients. In this paper, we described a prototype robotics system with sensing and actuation systems for safe perioperative transport, transfer and procedures for uncooperative combative children to maximize safety for patients and healthcare workers and to enhance operating theatre efficiency and throughput.
__label__0, Robertson's 2-poisson information retrieve model does not use location and category information. We constructed a framework using location and category information in a 2-poisson model. We submitted two systems based on this framework to the IREX contest, Japanese language information retrieval contest held in Japan in 1999. For precision in the A-judgement measure they scored 0.4926 and 0.4827, the highest values among the 15 teams and 22 systems that participated in the IREX contest. We describe our systems and the comparative experiments done when various parameters were changed. These experiments confirmed the effectiveness of using location and category information.
__label__0, We define the concept of dependence among multiple variables using maximum entropy techniques and introduce a graphical notation to denote the dependencies. Direct inference of information theoretic quantities from data uncovers dependencies even in undersampled regimes when the joint probability distribution cannot be reliably estimated. The method is tested on synthetic data. We anticipate it to be useful for inference of genetic circuits and other biological signaling networks.
__label__0, The design of a novel prismatic drive is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-O-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-O-Cam was reported elsewhere. This drive thus provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. Such properties can be used to design new transmissions for parallel-kinematics machines. In this paper, this transmission is optimized to replace ball-screws in Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot optimized for machining applications.
__label__0, This paper addresses the use of COTS microkernels in fault-tolerant, and, to some extent, safety-critical systems. The main issue is to assess the behavior of such components, upon which application software relies, in the presence of faults. Using fault injection, it is possible to classify the behavior of the functional primitives. From the results obtained fault containment mechanisms can be provided as a new API to complement the basic detection mechanisms of the microkernel. Some preliminary experiments with the Chorus microkernel are also reported.
__label__0, Purpose of review According to the WHO reports, around 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Despite its high prevalence, the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms underlying depression still needs to be elucidated. Recent findings Over the course of the last few years, several neurobiological alterations have been linked to the development and maintenance of depression. One basic process that seems to link many of these findings is inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been associated with both biological factors such as excessive neurotransmitter concentrations as well as psychological processes such as adult stress reactivity and a history of childhood trauma. As a balanced microbial community, modulated by diet, is a key regulator of the host physiology, it seems likely that gut microbiota plays a role in depression. Summary The review summarizes the existent literature on this emerging research field and provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted links between the microbiota, diet, and depression. Several pathways linking early life trauma, pharmacological treatment effects, and nutrition to the microbiome in depression are described aiming to foster the psychotherapeutic treatment of depressed patients by interventions targeting the microbiota.
__label__0, An interleaver is a critical component for the channel coding performance of turbo codes. Algebraic constructions are important because they admit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation. The spread factor of an interleaver is a common measure for turbo coding applications. Maximum-spread interleavers are interleavers whose spread factors achieve the upper bound. An infinite sequence of quadratic PPs over integer rings that generate maximum-spread interleavers is presented. New properties of PP interleavers are investigated from an algebraic-geometric perspective resulting in a new non- linearity metric for interleavers. A new interleaver metric that is a function of both the nonlinearity metric and the spread factor is proposed. It is numerically demonstrated that the spread factor has a diminishing importance with the block length. A table of good interleavers for a variety of interleaver lengths according to the new metric is listed. Extensive computer simulation results with impressive frame error rates confirm the efficacy of the new metric. Further, when tail-biting constituent codes are used, the resulting turbo codes are quasi-cyclic.
__label__0, This paper outlines a three-step procedure for determining the low bit error rate performance curve of a wide class of LDPC codes of moderate length. The traditional method to estimate code performance in the higher SNR region is to use a sum of the contributions of the most dominant error events to the probability of error. These dominant error events will be both code and decoder dependent, consisting of low-weight codewords as well as non-codeword events if ML decoding is not used. For even moderate length codes, it is not feasible to find all of these dominant error events with a brute force search. The proposed method provides a convenient way to evaluate very low bit error rate performance of an LDPC code without requiring knowledge of the complete error event weight spectrum or resorting to a Monte Carlo simulation. This new method can be applied to various types of decoding such as the full belief propagation version of the message passing algorithm or the commonly used min-sum approximation to belief propagation. The proposed method allows one to efficiently see error performance at bit error rates that were previously out of reach of Monte Carlo methods. This result will provide a solid foundation for the analysis and design of LDPC codes and decoders that are required to provide a guaranteed very low bit error rate performance at certain SNRs.
__label__0, There is a trend toward the use of predictive systems in communications networks. At the systems and network management level predictive capabilities are focused on anticipating network faults and performance degradation. Simultaneously, mobile communication networks are being developed with predictive location and tracking mechanisms. The interactions and synergies between these systems present a new set of problems. A new predictive network management framework is developed and examined. The interaction between a predictive mobile network and the proposed network management system is discussed. The Rapidly Deployable Radio Network is used as a specific exampl e to illustrate these interactions. 1
__label__0, Type classes are an elegant extension to traditional, Hindley-Milner based typing systems. They are used in modern, typed languages such as Haskell to support controlled overloading of symbols. Haskell 98 supports only single-parameter and constructor type classes. Other extensions such as multi-parameter type classes are highly desired but are still not officially supported by Haskell. Subtle issues arise with extensions, which may lead to a loss of feasible type inference or ambiguous programs. A proper logical basis for type class systems seems to be missing. Such a basis would allow extensions to be characterised and studied rigorously. We propose to employ Constraint Handling Rules as a tool to study and develop type class systems in a uniform way.
__label__0, Research into the automatic acquisition of lexical information from corpora is starting to produce large-scale computational lexicons containing data on the relative frequencies of subcategorisation alternatives for individual verbal predicates. However, the empirical question of whether this type of frequency information can in practice improve the accuracy of a statistical parser has not yet been answered. In this paper we describe an experiment with a wide-coverage statistical grammar and parser for English and subcategorisation frequencies acquired from ten million words of text which shows that this information can significantly improve parse accuracy.
__label__0, A high-level architecture of a Hybrid Reconfigurable CPU, based on a Philips-supported core processor, is introduced. It features the Philips XPLA2 CPLD as a reconfigurable functional unit. A compilation chain is presented, in which automatic implementation of time-critical program segments in custom hardware is performed. The entire process is transparent from the programmer's point of view. The hardware synthesis module of the chain, which translates segments of assembly code into a hardware netlist, is discussed in details. Application examples are also presented.
__label__0, We study the complexity of the model checking problem, for fixed model A, over certain fragments L of first-order logic. These are sometimes known as the expression complexities of L. We obtain various complexity classification theorems for these logics L as each ranges over models A, in the spirit of the dichotomy conjecture for the Constraint Satisfaction Problem -- which itself may be seen as the model checking problem for existential conjunctive positive first-order logic.
__label__0, The previously demonstrated correlation between the ocular pressure rise after topical application of corticosteroids and the plasma cortisol value after oral administration of dexamethasone as well as the previously demonstrated genetic nature of the former suggest that the latter is also heritable. In a study of 98 nuclear family groups, initial and final plasma cortisol levels were determined between 5 and 7 PM on successive days. The final cortisol was taken 24 hours after 0.75 mg of dexamethasone was administered orally. No clearcut evidence of heritability among first degree relatives was noted. An unexpected finding was a significant correlation between husband and wife pairs.
__label__0, The paper discusses the basic principles and the architecture of the software toolkit for constructing knowledge-based systems which can be used cooperatively over computer networks and also embedded into larger software systems in dierent ways. Presented architecture is based on frame knowledge representation and production rules, which also allows to interface high-level programming languages and relational databases by exposing corresponding classes or database tables as frames. Frames located on the remote computers can also be transparently accessed and used in inference, and the dynamic knowledge for specific frames can also be transferred over the network. The issues of implementation of such a system are addressed, which use Java programming language, CORBA and XML for external knowledge representation. Finally, some applications of the toolkit are considered, including e-business approach to knowledge sharing, intelligent web behaviours, etc.
__label__0, Searching techniques for Case Based Reasoning systems involve extensive methods of elimination. In this paper, we look at a new method of arriving at the right solution by performing a series of transformations upon the data. These involve N-gram based comparison and deduction of the input data with the case data, using Morphemes and Phonemes as the deciding parameters. A similar technique for eliminating possible errors using a noise removal function is performed. The error tracking and elimination is performed through a statistical analysis of obtained data, where the entire data set is analyzed as sub-categories of various etymological derivatives. A probability analysis for the closest match is then performed, which yields the final expression. This final expression is referred to the Case Base. The output is redirected through an Expert System based on best possible match. The threshold for the match is customizable, and could be set by the Knowledge-Architect.
__label__0, This paper describes a novel method of compiling ranked tagging rules into a deterministic finite-state device called a bimachine. The rules are formulated in the framework of regular rewrite operations and allow unrestricted regular expressions in both left and right rule contexts. The compiler is illustrated by an application within a speech synthesis system.
__label__0, Web attacks, i.e. attacks exclusively using the HTTP protocol, are rapidly becoming one of the fundamental threats for information systems connected to the Internet. When the attacks suffered by web servers through the years are analyzed, it is observed that most of them are very similar, using a reduced number of attacking techniques. It is generally agreed that classification can help designers and programmers to better understand attacks and build more secure applications. As an effort in this direction, a new taxonomy of web attacks is proposed in this paper, with the objective of obtaining a practically useful reference framework for security applications. The use of the taxonomy is illustrated by means of multiplatform real world web attack examples. Along with this taxonomy, important features of each attack category are discussed. A suitable semantic-dependent web attack encoding scheme is defined that uses different-length vectors. Possible applications are described, which might benefit from this taxonomy and encoding scheme, such as intrusion detection systems and application firewalls.
__label__0, This paper defines an argumentation semantics for extended logic programming and shows its equivalence to the well-founded semantics with explicit negation. We set up a general framework in which we extensively compare this semantics to other argumentation semantics, including those of Dung, and Prakken and Sartor. We present a general dialectical proof theory for these argumentation semantics.
__label__0, This paper presents an experimental study and the lessons learned from the observation of the attackers when logged on a compromised machine. The results are based on a six months period during which a controlled experiment has been run with a high interaction honeypot. We correlate our findings with those obtained with a worldwide distributed system of low-interaction honeypots
__label__0, The paper addresses geometric aspects of a spatial three-degree-of-freedom parallel module, which is the parallel module of a hybrid serial-parallel 5-axis machine tool. This parallel module consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three non-identical legs. Each leg is made up of one prismatic and two pairs of spherical joint, which are connected in a way that the combined effects of the three legs lead to an over-constrained mechanism with complex motion. This motion is defined as a simultaneous combination of rotation and translation. A method for computing the complete workspace of the VERNE parallel module for various tool lengths is presented. An algorithm describing this method is also introduced.
__label__0, Pseudocodewords of q-ary LDPC codes are examined and the weight of a pseudocodeword on the q-ary symmetric channel is defined. The weight definition of a pseudocodeword on the AWGN channel is also extended to two-dimensional q-ary modulation such as q-PAM and q-PSK. The tree-based lower bounds on the minimum pseudocodeword weight are shown to also hold for q-ary LDPC codes on these channels
__label__0, We describe a model of a communication network that allows  us to price complex network services as financial derivative contracts  based on the spot price of the capacity in individual routers. We  prove a theorem of a Girsanov transform that is useful for pricing  linear derivatives on underlying assets, which can be used to price  many complex network services, and it is used to price an option that  gives access to one of several virtual channels between two network  nodes, during a specified future time interval. We give the continuous  time hedging strategy, for which the option price is independent of  the service providers attitude towards risk. The option price contains  the density function of a sum of lognormal variables, which has to be  evaluated numerically.
__label__0, Robotic hardware designs are becoming more complex as the variety and number of on-board sensors increase and as greater computational power is provided in ever-smaller packages on-board robots. These advances in hardware, however, do not automatically translate into better software for controlling complex robots. Evolutionary techniques hold the potential to solve many difficult problems in robotics which defy simple conventional approaches, but present many challenges as well. Numerous disciplines including artificial life, cognitive science and neural networks, rule-based systems, behavior-based control, genetic algorithms and other forms of evolutionary computation have contributed to shaping the current state of evolutionary robotics. This paper provides an overview of developments in the emerging field of evolutionary robotics, and discusses some of the opportunities and challenges which currently face practitioners in the field.
__label__0, A multiple-access channel is considered in which messages from one encoder are confidential. Confidential messages are to be transmitted with perfect secrecy, as measured by equivocation at the other encoder. The upper bounds and the achievable rates for this communication situation are determined
__label__0, It is important that practical data-flow analyzers are backed by reliably proven theoretical results. Abstract interpretation provides a sound mathematical framework and necessary generic properties for an abstract domain to be well-defined and sound with respect to the concrete semantics. In logic programming, the abstract domain Sharing is a standard choice for sharing analysis for both practical work and further theoretical study. In spite of this, we found that there were no satisfactory proofs for the key properties of commutativity and idempotence that are essential for Sharing to be well-defined and that published statements of the soundness of Sharing assume the occurs-check. This paper provides a generalization of the abstraction function for Sharing that can be applied to any language, with or without the occurs-check. Results for soundness, idempotence and commutativity for abstract unification using this abstraction function are proven.
__label__0, We describe a simple, but efficient algorithm for the generation of dilated contours from bilevel images. The initial part of the contour extraction is explained to be a good candidate for parallel computer code generation. The remainder of the algorithm is of linear nature.
__label__0, In this article we review standard null-move pruning and introduce our extended version of it, which we call verified null-move pruning. In verified null-move pruning, whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth. Our experiments with verified null-move pruning show that on average, it constructs a smaller search tree with greater tactical strength in comparison to standard null-move pruning. Moreover, unlike standard null-move pruning, which fails badly in zugzwang positions, verified null-move pruning manages to detect most zugzwangs and in such cases conducts a re-search to obtain the correct result. In addition, verified null-move pruning is very easy to implement, and any standard null-move pruning program can use verified null-move pruning by modifying only a few lines of code.
__label__0, Conversational implicatures are usually described as being licensed by the disobeying or flouting of some principle by the speaker in cooperative dialogue. However, such work has failed to distinguish cases of the speaker flouting such a principle from cases where the speaker is either deceptive or holds a mistaken belief. In this paper, we demonstrate how the three different cases can be distinguished in terms of the beliefs ascribed to the speaker of the utterance. We argue that in the act of distinguishing the speaker's intention and ascribing such beliefs, the intended inference can be made by the hearer. This theory is implemented in ViewGen, a pre-existing belief modelling system used in a medical counselling domain.
__label__0, Building on ideas from linguistics, psychology, and social sciences about the possible mechanisms of human decision-making, we propose a novel theoretical framework for the citation analysis. Given the existing trend to investigate citation statistics in the context of various forms of power and Zipfian laws, we show that the popular models of citation have poor predictive ability and can hardly provide for an adequate explanation of the observed behavior of the empirical data. An alternative model is then derived, using the apparatus of statistical mechanics. The model is applied to approximate the citation frequencies of scientific articles from two large collections, and it demonstrates a predictive potential much superior to the one of any of the citation models known to the authors from the literature. Some analytical properties of the developed model are discussed, and conclusions are drawn. Directions for future work are also given at the paper's end.
__label__0, IEEE 754r is the ongoing revision to the IEEE 754 floating point standard and a major enhancement to the standard is the addition of decimal format. This paper proposes two novel BCD adders called carry skip and carry look-ahead BCD adders respectively. Furthermore, in the recent years, reversible logic has emerged as a promising technology having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. It is not possible to realize quantum computing without reversible logic. Thus, this paper also paper provides the reversible logic implementation of the conventional BCD adder as the well as the proposed carry skip BCD adder using a recently proposed TSG gate. Furthermore, a new reversible gate called TS-3 is also being proposed and it has been shown that the proposed reversible logic implementation of the BCD adders is much better compared to recently proposed one, in terms of number of reversible gates used and garbage outputs produced. The reversible BCD circuits designed and proposed here form the basis of the decimal ALU of a primitive quantum CPU.
__label__0, This invention relates to vehicles having parts connected with a sealing spring fastener, which comprises a U-shaped structure, on which an elastic body has been incorporated. The elastic body has a hermetically closed cavity within the U-shaped structure. The sealing spring fastener can form an assembly with an extension of a panel, preferably a plastic panel. The assembly or the fastener by itself can be engaged into the slot of a solid sheet, preferably a metal sheet, in a manner that one side of the sheet is sealed from the other side of the sheet in the vicinity of the slot. In a preferred version, the sealing fastener comprises a substantially non-elastic tough casing around portion of the elastic body in order to avoid rapture during insertion of the fastener into the slot.
__label__0, We demonstrate our game theory-based Texas Hold'em poker player. To overcome the computational difficulties stemming from Texas Hold'em's gigantic game tree, our player uses automated abstraction and real-time equilibrium approximation. Our player solves the first two rounds of the game in a large off-line computation, and solves the last two rounds in a real-time equilibrium approximation. Participants in the demonstration will be able to compete against our opponent and experience first-hand the cognitive abilities of our player. Some of the techniques used by our player, which does not directly incorporate any poker-specific expert knowledge, include such poker techniques as bluffing, slow-playing, check-raising, and semi-bluffing, all techniques normally associated with human play.
__label__0, ELAN is a powerful language and environment for specifying and prototyping deduction systems in a language based on rewrite rules controlled by strategies. Timed automata is a class of continuous real-time models of reactive systems for which efficient model-checking algorithms have been devised. In this paper, we show that these algorithms can very easily be prototyped in the ELAN system. This paper argues through this example that rewriting based systems relying on rules and strategies are a good framework to prototype, study and test rather efficiently symbolic model-checking algorithms, i.e. algorithms which involve combination of graph exploration rules, deduction rules, constraint solving techniques and decision procedures.
__label__0, The aim of the paper is to derive the complex-valued least-squares estimator for bias-noise mean and variance.
__label__0, Given the lack of word delimiters in written Japanese, word segmentation is generally considered a crucial first step in processing Japanese texts. Typical Japanese segmentation algorithms rely either on a lexicon and syntactic analysis or on pre-segmented data; but these are labor-intensive, and the lexico-syntactic techniques are vulnerable to the unknown word problem. In contrast, we introduce a novel, more robust statistical method utilizing unsegmented training data. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm yields performance on long kanji sequences comparable to and sometimes surpassing that of state-of-the-art morphological analyzers over a variety of error metrics. The algorithm also outperforms another mostly-unsupervised statistical algorithm previously proposed for Chinese. Additionally, we present a two-level annotation scheme for Japanese to incorporate multiple segmentation granularities, and introduce two novel evaluation metrics, both based on the notion of a compatible bracket, that can account for multiple granularities simultaneously.
__label__0, Currently, computational linguists and cognitive scientists working in the area of discourse and dialogue argue that their subjective judgments are reliable using several different statistics, none of which are easily interpretable or comparable to each other. Meanwhile, researchers in content analysis have already experienced the same difficulties and come up with a solution in the kappa statistic. We discuss what is wrong with reliability measures as they are currently used for discourse and dialogue work in computational linguistics and cognitive science, and argue that we would be better off as a field adopting techniques from content analysis.
__label__0, Analyses language modeling in spoken dialogue systems for accessing a database. The use of several language models obtained by exploiting dialogue predictions gives better results than the use of a single model for the whole dialogue interaction. For this reason, several models have been created, each one for a specific system question, such as the request for or the confirmation of a parameter. The use of dialogue-dependent language models increases the performance both at the recognition level and at the understanding level, especially on answers to system requests. Moreover, using other methods to increase the performance, like the automatic clustering of vocabulary words or the use of better acoustic models during recognition, does not affect the improvements given by dialogue-dependent language models. The system used in our experiments is Dialogos, the Italian spoken dialogue system used for accessing railway timetable information over the telephone. The experiments were carried out on a large corpus of dialogues collected using Dialogos.
__label__0, The provably asymptotically fastest algorithm within a factor of 5 for formally described problems will be constructed. The main idea is to enumerate all programs provably equivalent to the original problem by enumerating all proofs. The algorithm could be interpreted as a generalization and improvement of Levin search, which is, within a multiplicative constant, the fastest algorithm for inverting functions. Blum's speed-up theorem is avoided by taking into account only programs for which a correctness proof exists. Furthermore, it is shown that the fastest program that computes a certain function is also one of the shortest programs provably computing this function. To quantify this statement, the definition of Kolmogorov complexity is extended, and two new natural measures for the complexity of a function are defined.
__label__0, SPARQL is the standard language for querying RDF data. In this article, we address systematically the formal study of the database aspects of SPARQL, concentrating in its graph pattern matching facility. We provide a compositional semantics for the core part of SPARQL, and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language. Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries.
__label__0, A set-theoretic framework is proposed for granular computing. Each element of a universe is associated with a nonempty family of neighborhoods. A neighborhood of an element consists of those elements that are drawn towards that element by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity, or functionality. It is a granule containing the element. A neighborhood system is a family of granules, which is the available information or knowledge for granular computing. Operations on neighborhood systems, such as complement, intersection, and union, are defined by extending set-theoretic operations. They provide a basis of the proposed framework of granular computing. Using this framework, we examine the notions of rough sets and qualitative fuzzy sets.
__label__0, A class of distortions termed functional Bregman divergences is defined, which includes squared error and relative entropy. A functional Bregman divergence acts on functions or distributions, and generalizes the standard Bregman divergence for vectors and a previous pointwise Bregman divergence that was defined for functions. A recent result showed that the mean minimizes the expected Bregman divergence. The new functional definition enables the extension of this result to the continuous case to show that the mean minimizes the expected functional Bregman divergence over a set of functions or distributions. It is shown how this theorem applies to the Bayesian estimation of distributions. Estimation of the uniform distribution from independent and identically drawn samples is presented as a case study.
__label__0, It is shown how consistent histories quantum cosmology can be realized through Isham's histories projection operator consistent histories scheme. This is done by using an affine algebra instead of a canonical one and also by using cocycle representations. A regularization scheme allows us to find a history Hamiltonian which exists as a proper self-adjoint operator. The role of a cocycle choice is also discussed.
__label__0, Text recognition in natural scenes is challenging due to the variations on text font, font size, color and scene background. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recognize scene characters based on born-digital template matching, which is formulated by a Morkov Random Field framework by combining both local point features and global spatial structures of scene characters to improve the accuracy. Then the character recognition result of the proposed MRF framework is determined by the votes from multiple one-versus-one classifiers. The experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the recent state-of-the-art natural scene recognition methods.
__label__0,     The paper citation network is a traditional social medium for the exchange of ideas and knowledge. In this paper we examine information diffusion in citation networks by analyzing the correlations between various citation choices and the subsequent impact of the articles. We find that citing recent papers and papers within the same scholarly community garners a slightly larger number of citations on average. However, this correlation is weaker among well-cited papers implying that for high impact work citing within one's field is of lesser importance.   
__label__0, We present a multi-document summarizer, called MEAD, which generates summaries using cluster centroids produced by a topic detection and tracking system. We also describe two new techniques, based on sentence utility and subsumption, which we have applied to the evaluation of both single and multiple document summaries. Finally, we describe two user studies that test our models of multi-document summarization.
__label__0, This paper considers the design of a minimax test for two hypotheses where the actual probability densities of the observations are located in neighborhoods obtained by placing a bound on the relative entropy between actual and nominal densities. The minimax problem admits a saddle point which is characterized. The robust test applies a nonlinear transformation which flattens the nominal likelihood ratio in the vicinity of one. Results are illustrated by considering the transmission of binary data in the presence of additive noise.
__label__0, Distributed source coding schemes are typically based on the use of channels codes as source codes. In this paper we propose a new paradigm, termed "distributed arithmetic coding", which exploits the fact that arithmetic codes are good source as well as channel codes. In particular, we propose a distributed binary arithmetic coder for Slepian-Wolf coding with decoder side information, along with a soft joint decoder. The proposed scheme provides several advantages over existing Slepian-Wolf coders, especially its good performance at small block lengths, and the ability to incorporate arbitrary source models in the encoding process, e.g. context-based statistical models. We have compared the performance of distributed arithmetic coding with turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes, and found that the proposed approach has very competitive performance.
__label__0, Most algorithms in 3D computer vision rely on the pinhole camera model because of its simplicity, whereas virtually all imaging devices introduce a certain amount of nonlinear distortion, where the radial distortion is the most severe part. Common approach to radial distortion is by the means of polynomial approximation, which introduces distortion-specific parameters into the camera model and requires estimation of these distortion parameters. The task of estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new radial distortion model with an easy analytical undistortion formula, which also belongs to the polynomial approximation category. Experimental results are presented to show that with this radial distortion model, satisfactory accuracy is achieved. An application of the new radial distortion model is non-iterative yellow line alignment with a calibrated camera on ODIS, a robot built in our CSOIS.
__label__0, The paper presents a concept of a ship motion control system, which is able to perform a turn along the desired arc. The proposed course control autopilot employs the structure of the cascade system and the Internal Model Control approach, which ensures high quality of operation during course-tracking, obtained by extension to the nonlinear form. The article presents results of simulations illustrating advantages of the tested ship motion control method.
__label__0, The error exponent of Markov channels with feedback is studied in the variable-length block-coding setting. Burnashev's classic result is extended and a single letter characterization for the reliability function of finite-state Markov channels is presented, under the assumption that the channel state is causally observed both at the transmitter and at the receiver side. Tools from stochastic control theory are used in order to treat channels with intersymbol interference. In particular the convex analytical approach to Markov decision processes is adopted to handle problems with stopping time horizons arising from variable-length coding schemes.
__label__0, This paper presents Dialogos, a real-time system for human-machine spoken dialogue on the telephone in task-oriented domains. The system has been tested in a large trial with inexperienced users and it has proved robust enough to allow spontaneous interactions both to users which get good recognition performance and to the ones which get lower scores. The robust behavior of the system has been achieved by combining the use of specific language models during the recognition phase of analysis, the tolerance toward spontaneous speech phenomena, the activity of a robust parser, and the use of pragmatic-based dialogue knowledge. This integration of the different modules allows to deal with partial or total breakdowns of the different levels of analysis. We report the field trial data of the system and the evaluation results of the overall system and of the submodules.
__label__0, Semantic knowledge can be a great asset to natural language processing systems, but it is usually hand-coded for each application. Although some semantic information is available in general-purpose knowledge bases such as WordNet and Cyc, many applications require domain-specific lexicons that represent words and categories for a particular topic. In this paper, we present a corpus-based method that can be used to build semantic lexicons for specific categories. The input to the system is a small set of seed words for a category and a representative text corpus. The output is a ranked list of words that are associated with the category. A user then reviews the top-ranked words and decides which ones should be entered in the semantic lexicon. In experiments with five categories, users typically found about 60 words per category in 10-15 minutes to build a core semantic lexicon.
__label__0, This article describes various advantages and disadvantages of SMS, WAP, J2ME and Windows CE technologies in designing mobile applications. In defining the architecture of any software application it is important to get the best trade-off between platform's possibilities and design requirements. Achieving optimum software design is even more important with mobile applications where all computer resources are limited. Therefore, it is important to have a comparative analysis of all relevant contemporary approaches in designing mobile applications. As always, the choice between these technologies is determined by application requirements and system capabilities.
__label__0, For over a decade, researchers in formal methods tried to create formalisms that permit natural specification of systems and allow mathematical reasoning about their correctness. The availability of fully-automated reasoning tools enables more non-specialists to use formal methods effectively-their responsibility reduces to just specifying the model and expressing the desired properties. Thus, it is essential that these properties be represented in a language that is easy to use and sufficiently expressive. Linear-time temporal logic is a formalism that has been extensively used by researchers for specifying properties of systems. When such properties are closed under stuttering, i.e. their interpretation is not modified by transitions that leave the system in the same state, verification tools can utilize a partial-order reduction technique to reduce the size of the model and thus analyze larger systems. If LTL formulas do not contain the "next" operator, the formulas are closed under stuttering, but the resulting language is not expressive enough to capture many important properties, e.g., properties involving events. Determining if an arbitrary LTL formula is closed under stuttering is hard-it has been proven to be PSPACE-complete. We relax the restriction on LTL that guarantees closure under stuttering, introduce the notion of edges in the context of LTL, and provide theorems that enable syntactic reasoning about closure under stuttering of LTL formulas.
__label__0, This paper presents a new foundational approach to reason about available bandwidth estimation as the analysis of a min-plus linear system. The available bandwidth of a link or complete path is expressed in terms of a service curve, which is a function that appears in the network calculus to express the service available to a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a sequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of arrivals. It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived in the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further mathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of estimating available bandwidth from measurements of network probes are related to potential nonlinearities of the underlying network. When networks are viewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a nonlinear regime, it is argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the network crosses from a linear to a nonlinear regime. Experiments on the Emulab testbed at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, evaluate the robustness of the system-theoretic interpretation of networks in practice. Multinode experiments evaluate how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides estimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of individual links.
__label__0, To study mechanisms that cause the non-Gaussian nature of network traac, we analyzed IP ow statistics. For greedy ows in particular, we investigated the hop counts between source and destination nodes, and classiied applications by the port number. We found that the main ows contributing to the non-Gaussian nature of network traac were HTTP ows with relatively small hop counts compared with the average hop counts of all ows.
__label__0, Many augmented reality systems use general purpose computing hardware to perform tasks such as rendering computer graphics, video overlay, and vision tracking. This can result in systems being large and bulky due to the hardware complexity required and the power consumed. We have developed a hand tracking solution in a reconfigurable computer, which reduces power consumption and transfers some of the processing into specialised hardware. This paper presents a summary of the design and its implementation details.
__label__0, Research in distributed AI has led to computational techniques for providing AI systems with rudimentary social skills. This paper gives a brief survey of distributed AI, describing the work that strives for social skills that a person might acquire in kindergarten, and highlighting important unresolved problems facing the field.
__label__0, Consider a system F of n polynomial equations in n unknowns, over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. We present a fast method to find a point in every irreducible component of the zero set Z of F. Our techniques allow us to sharpen and lower prior complexity bounds for this problem by fully taking into account the monomial term structure. As a corollary of our development we also obtain new explicit formulae for the exact number of isolated roots of F and the intersection multiplicity of the positive-dimensional part of Z. Finally, we present a combinatorial construction of non-degenerate polynomial systems, with specified monomial term structure and maximally many isolated roots, which may be of independent interest.
__label__0, In this paper we present results related to achieving finegrained activity recognition for context-aware computing applications. We examine the advantages and challenges of reasoning with globally unique object instances detected by an RFID glove. We present a sequence of increasingly powerful probabilistic graphical models for activity recognition. We show the advantages of adding additional complexity and conclude with a model that can reason tractably about aggregated object instances and gracefully generalizes from object instances to their classes by using abstraction smoothing. We apply these models to data collected from a morning household routine.
__label__0, As the cloud computing paradigm has gained prominence, the need for verifiable computation has grown increasingly urgent. The concept of verifiable computation enables a weak client to outsource difficult computations to a powerful, but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation aim to provide the client with a guarantee that the server performed the requested computations correctly, without requiring the client to perform the computations herself. By design, these protocols impose a minimal computational burden on the client. However, existing protocols require the server to perform a large amount of extra bookkeeping in order to enable a client to easily verify the results. Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical curiosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in real cloud computing systems.  Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for verifiable computation. To this end, we identify abundant data parallelism in a state-of-the-art general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation, originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the GPU, obtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a state-of-the-art sequential implementation. For benchmark problems, our implementation reduces the slowdown of the server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original computations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce the already small runtime of the client by 100x. Similarly, we obtain 20-50x server-side and client-side speedups for related protocols targeted at specific streaming problems. We believe our results demonstrate the immediate practicality of using GPUs for verifiable computation, and more generally that protocols for verifiable computation have become sufficiently mature to deploy in real cloud computing systems.
__label__0, We investigate whether one can determine from the transcripts of U.S. Congressional floor debates whether the speeches represent support of or opposition to proposed legislation. To address this problem, we exploit the fact that these speeches occur as part of a discussion; this allows us to use sources of information regarding relationships between discourse segments, such as whether a given utterance indicates agreement with the opinion expressed by another. We find that the incorporation of such information yields substantial improvements over classifying speeches in isolation.
__label__0, Modern performance tools provide methods for easy integration into an application for performance evaluation. For a large-scale scientific software package that has been under development for decades and with developers around the world, several obstacles must be overcome in order to utilize modern performance tools and explore performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we present our experience in integrating performance tools with one popular computational chemistry package. We discuss the difficulties we encountered and the mechanisms developed to integrate performance tools into this code. With performance tools integrated, we show one of the initial performance evaluation results, and discuss what other challenges we are facing to conduct performance evaluation for large-scale scientific packages.
__label__0, We propose a method for segmentation of expository texts based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The method uses paragraphs as the basic segments for identifying hierarchical discourse structure in the text, applying lexical similarity between them as the proximity test. Linear segmentation can be induced from the identified structure through application of two simple rules. However the hierarchy can be used also for intelligent exploration of the text. The proposed segmentation algorithm is evaluated against an accepted linear segmentation method and shows comparable results.

__label__0, For this issue, James Cheney describes nominal logic, an approach to solve the problems involved with reasoning about bindings in formal languages that has been gaining in popularity in recent years, and surveys its major application areas.
__label__0, We present a propositional logic to reason about the uncertainty of events, where the uncertainty is modeled by a set of probability measures assigning an interval of probability to each event. We give a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic, and show that the satisfiability problem is NP-complete, no harder than satisfiability for propositional logic.
__label__0, We present an efficient and practical lock-free implementation of a concurrent deque that is disjoint-parallel accessible and uses atomic primitives which are available in modern computer systems. Previously known lock-free algorithms of deques are either based on non-available atomic synchronization primitives, only implement a subset of the functionality, or are not designed for disjoint accesses. Our algorithm is based on a doubly linked list, and only requires single-word compare-and-swap atomic primitives, even for dynamic memory sizes. We have performed an empirical study using full implementations of the most efficient algorithms of lock-free deques known. For systems with low concurrency, the algorithm by Michael shows the best performance. However, as our algorithm is designed for disjoint accesses, it performs significantly better on systems with high concurrency and non-uniform memory architecture.
__label__0, We analyze a few of the commonly used statistics based and machine learning algorithms for natural language disambiguation tasks and observe that they can be recast as learning linear separators in the feature space. Each of the methods makes a priori assumptions which it employs, given the data, when searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem.We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large number of attributes.In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our approach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably to the best.
__label__0, The two principal areas of natural language processing research in pragmantics are belief modelling and speech act processing. Belief modelling is the development of techniques to represent the mental attitudes of a dialogue participant. The latter approach, speech act processing, based on speech act theory, involves viewing dialogue in planning terms. Utterances in a dialogue are modelled as steps in a plan where understanding an utterance involves deriving the complete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. However, previous speech act based approaches have been limited by a reliance upon relatively simplistic belief modelling techniques and their relationship to planning and plan recognition. In particular, such techniques assume precomputed nested belief structures. In this paper, we will present an approach to speech act processing based on novel belief modelling techniques where nested beliefs are propagated on demand.
__label__0, We study the asymptotic distribution of the displacements in hashing with coalesced chains, for both late-insertion and early-insertion. Asymptotic formulas for means and variances follow. The method uses Poissonization and some stochastic calculus.
__label__0, Although it has contributed to remarkable improvements in some specific areas, attempts to develop a universal design theory are generally characterized by failure. This paper sketches arguments for a new approach to engineering design based on Semiotics - the science about signs. The approach is to combine different design theories over all the product life cycle stages into one coherent and traceable framework. Besides, it is to bring together the designer's and user's understandings of the notion of 'good product'. Building on the insight from natural sciences that complex systems always exhibit a self-organizing meaning-influential hierarchical dynamics, objective laws controlling product development are found through an examination of design as a semiosis process. These laws are then applied to support evolutionary design of products. An experiment validating some of the theoretical findings is outlined, and concluding remarks are given.
__label__0, The paper presents a hybrid system controller, incorporating a neural and an LQG controller. The neural controller has been optimized by genetic algorithms directly on the inverted pendulum system. The failure-free optimization process stipulated a relatively small region of the asymptotic stability of the neural controller, which is concentrated around the regulation point. The presented hybrid controller combines benefits of a genetically optimized neural controller and an LQG controller in a single system controller. High quality of the regulation process is achieved through utilization of the neural controller, while stability of the system during transient processes and a wide range of operation are assured through application of the LQG controller. The hybrid controller has been validated by applying it to a simulation model of an inherently unstable system - the inverted pendulum.
__label__0, We study the formation of diffraction patterns in the near-resonant imaging of trapped cold atomic samples. We show that the spatial imaging can provide detailed information on the trapped atomic clouds.
__label__0, We investigate here the computational complexity of three natural problems in directed acyclic graphs. We prove their NP Completeness and consider their restrictions to linear orders.
__label__0, In this paper, we propose an achievable rate region for discrete memoryless interference channels with conferencing at the transmitter side. We employ superposition block Markov encoding, combined with simultaneous superposition coding, dirty paper coding, and random binning to obtain the achievable rate region. We show that, under respective conditions, the proposed achievable region reduces to Han and Kobayashi's achievable region for interference channels, the capacity region for degraded relay channels, and the capacity region for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case are given.
__label__0, X-raycrystallographers depend on software to process and analyze their data. These programswere often developed withemphasis on mathematical algorithms rather than inputand outputcontrol. As a result, these programs can be difficult to set up. This paperdiscusses a specific dataprocessing program, scaling, which is the laststep in crystallographydataprocessing. It computesthe scalefactors for the different X-rayimages and merges them to obtain a list ofthe Braggreflection intensities.
__label__0, Essentially all distributed systems, applications, and services at some level boil down to the problem of managing distributed shared state. Unfortunately, while the problem of managing distributed shared state is shared by many applications, there is no common means of managing the data-every application devises its own solution. We have developed Khazana, a distributed service exporting the abstraction of a distributed persistent globally shared store that applications can use to store their shared state. Khazana is responsible for performing many of the common operations needed by distributed applications, including replication, consistency management, fault recovery, access control and location management. Using Khazana as a form of middleware, distributed applications can be quickly developed from corresponding uniprocessor applications through the insertion of Khazana data access and synchronization operations.
__label__0, Developments in the field of computer science are creating new methods of learning and teaching. Digital storytelling is one of those fields, which is offering a new way of to educate people. This paper explores potential applications of digital storytelling on different educational levels and will investigate if there is an interest for these applications on the educational market.
__label__0, During the practice of every gynaecologist there have been women whose only complaint have been pelvic pain. In recent years the pelvic pain occupies one of the leading positions as an indication for laparoscopy. The author has carried out observations over 69 patients with such problems. The phlogistic changes of the adnexa have been the most frequent endoscopic finding, followed by the endometriosis. The other pathological changes in the small pelvis combined with pelvic pain have been the varicose changes in the vascular net of the ovaries, the mesosalpinx and the parameters. The author recommends laparoscopy for objectivization of the changes in the small pelvis and for determining the appropriate medical approach.
__label__0, Software problems originate from real world problems. A software solution must address its real world problem in a satisfactory way. A software engineer must therefore understand the real world problem that their software intends to address. To be able to do this, the software engineer must understand the problem context and how it is to be affected by the proposed software, expressed as the requirements. Without this knowledge the engineer can only hope to chance upon the right solution for the problem. Application of the Problem Frames approach may well be a way of meeting this need.
__label__0, In this paper, we bring together two important ideas in the semantics of Algol-like imperative programming languages. One is that program phrases act on xed sets of storage locations. The second is that the information of local variables is hidden from client programs. This involves combining sheaf theory and parametricity to produce new classes of sheaves. We deene the semantics of an Algol-like language using such sheaves and discuss the reasoning principles validated by the semantics.
__label__0, This paper presents the results of a study on the semantic constraints imposed on lexical choice by certain contextual indicators. We show how such indicators are computed and how correlations between them and the choice of a noun phrase description of a named entity can be automatically established using supervised learning. Based on this correlation, we have developed a technique for automatic lexical choice of descriptions of entities in text generation. We discuss the underlying relationship between the pragmatics of choosing an appropriate description that serves a specific purpose in the automatically generated text and the semantics of the description itself. We present our work in the framework of the more general concept of reuse of linguistic structures that are automatically extracted from large corpora. We present a formal evaluation of our approach and we conclude with some thoughts on potential applications of our method.
__label__0, We have developed a simple technique for demonstrating the sagittal profile of each rotated level of a scoliotic spine and used it to determine the patterns of lordosis and kyphosis in each of six clinical types of idiopathic scoliosis. The currently accepted classification of scoliosis is inaccurate and a modification is proposed. The three main types of scoliosis were shown to have sagittal profiles distinctly different from each other and from normal. Single structural curves had short lordotic sections at their apices, limited above and below by kyphosis. Double curves showed longer lordotic sections limited only by one area of kyphosis. Lordosis throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine was associated with triple curve patterns. The biomechanical effects of the abnormal sagittal profiles provide a simple explanation for the genesis and progression of the different types of scoliosis, and the recognition of the pattern of the sagittal abnormalities permits treatment to be designed on a sound anatomical basis for individual cases.
__label__0, We provide a position-patch based face hallucination method using convex optimization. Recently, a novel position-patch based face hallucination method has been proposed to save computational time and achieve high-quality hallucinated results. This method has employed least square estimation to obtain the optimal weights for face hallucination. However, the least square estimation approach can provide biased solutions when the number of the training position-patches is much larger than the dimension of the patch. To overcome this problem, this letter proposes a new position-patch based face hallucination method which is based on convex optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is very effective in producing high-quality hallucinated face images.
__label__0, Older patients experience adverse drug events more frequently than do younger adults, and they experience them in unexpected ways. The heterogeneity of the geriatric population leaves the investigator with a great deal of uncertainty and the clinician with little reliable guidance based on clinical investigations. Although few generalizations can be made, it is safe to say that at least a subgroup of patients exhibit one or more physiologic or pathologic alterations that can lead to unanticipated drug response. It is essential for the prescribing clinician to be mindful of the vulnerability of this population. Prescribing should be judicious and, in general, conservative, with an eye on the patient's specific vulnerabilities.
__label__0, Two general protocols are developed for the regioselective synthesis of 1,3,5-tri- and 1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted pyrazoles by the reaction of electron-deficient N-arylhydrazones with nitroolefins. Studies on the stereochemistry of the key pyrazolidine intermediate suggest a stepwise cycloaddition mechanism.
__label__0, For years, Caisse des Depots et Consignations has produced information filtering applications. To be operational, these applications require high filtering performances which are achieved by using rule-based filters. With this technique, an administrator has to tune a set of rules for each topic. However, filters become obsolescent over time. The decrease of their performances is due to diachronic polysemy of terms that involves a loss of precision and to diachronic polymorphism of concepts that involves a loss of recall.    To help the administrator to maintain his filters, we have developed a method which automatically detects filtering obsolescence. It consists in making a learning-based control filter using a set of documents which have already been categorised as relevant or not relevant by the rule-based filter. The idea is to supervise this filter by processing a differential comparison of its outcomes with those of the control one.    This method has many advantages. It is simple to implement since the training set used by the learning is supplied by the rule-based filter. Thus, both the making and the use of the control filter are fully automatic. With automatic detection of obsolescence, learning-based filtering finds a rich application which offers interesting prospects.
__label__0, This article describes the implementation of a system designed to automatically detect the presence of pulmonary embolism in lung scans. These images are firstly segmented, before alignment and feature extraction using PCA. The neural network was trained using the Hybrid Monte Carlo method, resulting in a committee of 250 neural networks and good results are obtained.
__label__0, This work considers the problem of transmitting multiple compressible sources over a network with minimum cost. The problem is complicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region of distributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints that is exponential in the number of sources that renders general purpose solvers inefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupled with dual decomposition and subgradient methods.
__label__0, All living body has been shown to emit radiation into space surrounding their body. The radiation field encloses the physical body and emits the characteristics of frequency radiation. This study discusses the analysis of human body radiation wave on the human torso and compares their frequency characteristics between genders. At first, the characteristic of radiation frequency is determined by employing statistical analysis of correlation and analysis of variance. The results show that the characteristic difference of radiation frequency between males and females in human torso is significant. Then, for the purpose of classification, the k-nearest neighbor is used as classification algorithm. The results show that the proposed technique properly classifies gender with accuracy of 100 percent. Experimental results recommend that the proposed technique is appropriate and capable to classify gender using frequency analysis of the human torso radiation.
__label__0, A belief-propagation decoder for low-density lattice codes, which represents messages explicitly as a mixture of Gaussians functions, is given. In order to prevent the number of functions from growing as the decoder iterations progress, a method for reducing the number of Gaussians at each step is given. A squared distance metric is used, which is shown to be a lower bound on the divergence. For an unconstrained power system, comparisons are made with a quantized implementation. For a dimension 100 lattice, a loss of about 0.2 dB was found; for dimension 1000 and 10000 lattices, the difference in error rate was indistinguishable. The memory required to store the messages is substantially superior to the quantized implementation.
__label__0, Directed signature is the solution of such problems when the signed message contains information sensitive to the signature receiver. Generally, in many application of directed signature, the signer is generally a single person. But when the message is on behalf of an organization, a valid sensitive message may require the approval of several people. Threshold signature schemes are used to solve these problems. This paper presents a threshold directed signature scheme.
__label__0, Computing practice today depends on visual output to drive almost all user interaction. Other senses, such as audition, may be totally neglected, or used tangentially, or used in highly restricted specialized ways. We have excellent audio rendering through D-A conversion, but we lack rich general facilities for modeling and manipulating sound comparable in quality and flexibility to graphics. We need co-ordinated research in several disciplines to improve the use of sound as an interactive information channel. Incremental and separate improvements in synthesis, analysis, speech processing, audiology, acoustics, music, etc. will not alone produce the radical progress that we seek in sonic practice. We also need to create a new central topic of study in digital audio research. The new topic will assimilate the contributions of different disciplines on a common foundation. The key central concept that we lack is sound as a general-purpose information channel. We must investigate the structure of this information channel, which is driven by the co-operative development of auditory perception and physical sound production. Particular audible encodings, such as speech and music, illuminate sonic information by example, but they are no more sufficient for a characterization than typography is sufficient for a characterization of visual information. To develop this new conceptual topic of sonic information structure, we need to integrate insights from a number of different disciplines that deal with sound. In particular, we need to co-ordinate central and foundational studies of the representational models of sound
__label__0, Recently we developed a periodic surface model to assist the construction of nano structures parametrically for computer-aided nano-design. In this paper, we study the properties of periodic surfaces for degree elevation and reduction. Degree elevation approaches are developed to incrementally increase shape complexities, including native, variational, and boundary constrained elevations. A generic degree reduction operation is defined for surface approximation based on an algebraic distance. The goal is to enhance the flexibility of the periodic surface model and allow for multi-resolution representation.
__label__0, OBJECTIVE To summarize the reasons of complications after prosthetic augmentation mammaplasty and explore the optimal preventive measures and therapy.   METHOD The reasons for 40 patients who were re-operated on after prosthetic augmentation mammaplasty were analyzed in as many aspects as possible, such as the location of the incision, the type of the prosthesis, etc. Preventive measures and therapy of the complications were also summarized.   RESULTS Capsular contracture was the most common reason for reoperation. The second was prosthetic rupture and translocation. The main reasons resulting in complications included impertinent indications, poor quality of the prosthesis and an incompetent surgeon.   CONCLUSIONS The key to reduce the complications is proper selection of good prosthesis, strict indications, better comprehension of the knowledge about prosthetic augmentation mammaplasty and a qualified plastic and aesthetic surgeon for the operation. The inareolar incision is the best choice to remedy the complications.
__label__0, The design of sensor networks capable of reaching a consensus on a globally optimal decision test, without the need for a fusion center, is a problem that has received considerable attention in the last years. Many consensus algorithms have been proposed, with convergence conditions depending on the graph describing the interaction among the nodes. In most works, the graph is undirected and there are no propagation delays. Only recently, the analysis has been extended to consensus algorithms incorporating propagation delays. In this correspondence, we propose a consensus algorithm able to converge to a globally optimal decision statistic, using a wideband wireless network, governed by a fairly simple MAC mechanism, where each link is a multipath, frequency-selective, channel. The main contribution of the correspondence is to derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology and sufficient conditions on the channel transfer functions guaranteeing the exponential convergence of the consensus algorithm to a globally optimal decision value, for any bounded delay condition.
__label__0, In mobile healthcare, medical information are often expressed in different formats due to the local poli- cies and regulations and the heterogeneity of the applications, systems, and the adopted Information and Communication technology. This chapter describes a framework which enables medical information, in particular clinical vital signs and professional annotations, be processed, exchanged, stored and managed modularly and flexibly in a mobile, distributed and heterogeneous environment despite the diversity of the formats used to represent the information. To deal with medical information represented
__label__0, Malignant stem cells have recently been described as the source of several types of human cancer. These unique cell types are typically rare and possess properties that are distinct from most other tumor cells. In leukemia, the natural properties of cancer stem cells indicate that current chemotherapy drugs will not be effective. Consequently, new strategies are required that specifically and preferentially target the cancer stem cell population, whilst sparing normal stem cells. This perspective article summarizes recent findings in the leukemia stem cell field and discusses new directions for therapy.
__label__0, The personalized recommending system approaches have been widely been employed in e-commerce to help users find items they like. Recommender algorithm is the core of the personalized recommending system. The Slope One algorithm is a commonly used collaborative filtering algorithm. It is a much simpler algorithm that not only easy to maintain but also easy to extende. But it do not adequately consider the user similarity and item similarity. This paper proposes a new algorithm to improve its drawbacks. The algorithm add the user similarity and item similarity as the weighting factors. The Experimental analysis on MovieLens datasets shows that the improved algorithm can get a better prediction accuracy and have a better constringency speed.
__label__0, Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a common congenital anomaly of uncertain etiology. Its association with multiple congenital anomalies in various organs is well recognized and antenatal radiological evidence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia warrants thorough evaluation to detect other anomalies, some of which can be life threatening. Rarely, heterotopic hepatic tissue is identified in the hernia, a rare pathological finding, exhibiting more than one macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, and always associated with cardiac congenital anomalies. Herein, we report a case of left-sided microscopic heterotopic hepatic tissue in a congenital diaphragmatic hernia in an infant with multiple cardiac congenital anomalies, but with preserved pericardium.
__label__0, The problem of error-control in random linear network coding is considered. A ldquononcoherentrdquo or ldquochannel obliviousrdquo model is assumed where neither transmitter nor receiver is assumed to have knowledge of the channel transfer characteristic. Motivated by the property that linear network coding is vector-space preserving, information transmission is modeled as the injection into the network of a basis for a vector space V and the collection by the receiver of a basis for a vector space U. A metric on the projective geometry associated with the packet space is introduced, and it is shown that a minimum-distance decoder for this metric achieves correct decoding if the dimension of the space V capU is sufficiently large. If the dimension of each codeword is restricted to a fixed integer, the code forms a subset of a finite-field Grassmannian, or, equivalently, a subset of the vertices of the corresponding Grassmann graph. Sphere-packing and sphere-covering bounds as well as a generalization of the singleton bound are provided for such codes. Finally, a Reed-Solomon-like code construction, related to Gabidulin's construction of maximum rank-distance codes, is described and a Sudan-style ldquolist-1rdquo minimum-distance decoding algorithm is provided.
__label__0, In the context of investment analysis, we formulate an abstract online computing problem called a planning game and develop general tools for solving such a game. We then use the tools to investigate a practical buy-and-hold trading problem faced by long-term investors in stocks. We obtain the unique optimal static online algorithm for the problem and determine its exact competitive ratio. We also compare this algorithm with the popular dollar averaging strategy using actual market data.

__label__0, Extraction and quantitative determination of progesterone, testosterone and oestrogens have been made in tissues of cephalopod molluscs and crustaceans. Extraction was made by acetone and ethyl ether. Purification was performed by thin layer chromatography on aluminium oxide and silicagel in different systems. The quantitative assay of progesterone and oestrogens was made by fluorimetric and radioimmunological techniques, that of testosterone--by spectrophotometric determination of hydrozones and radioimmunological procedure. Progesterone and testosterone were obtained from the gonads and liver of cephalopods and from the whole body of crustaceans. During sexual maturation of the animals concentration of these hormones tends to increase. Oestrone and oestradiol were found only in the gonads of cephalopods.
__label__0, We describe the occurrence of two anatomically separate and histologically distinct endocrine tumours of bronchus and pancreas in a 64 year old woman with biopsy and serology proven Goodpasture's syndrome. The association between anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease and multiple endocrine tumours has not been reported previously; possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed.
__label__0, We propose a method to generate large-scale encyclopedic knowledge, which is valuable for much NLP research, based on the Web. We first search the Web for pages containing a term in question. Then we use linguistic patterns and HTML structures to extract text fragments describing the term. Finally, we organize extracted term descriptions based on word senses and domains. In addition, we apply an automatically generated encyclopedia to a question answering system targeting the Japanese Information-Technology Engineers Examination.
__label__0, Ketchel and Williams postulated a "volatile factor" which participates in the differentiation of insect spermatocytes in vitro. It was found not to be a specific product of developing cysts. Instead, its effects are duplicated by a number of reagents which have only a high water content in common. The hypothesis that the volatile factor is water was experimentally confirmed.
__label__0, Phonetic ambiguity and confusibility are bugbears for any form of bottom-up or data-driven approach to language processing. The question of when an input is " close enough " to a target word pervades the entire problem spaces of speech recognition, synthesis, language acquisition, speech compression, and language representation, but the variety of representations that have been applied are demonstrably inadequate to at least some aspects of the problem. This paper reviews this inadequacy by examining several touchstone models in phonetic ambiguity and relating them to the problems they were designed to solve. An good solution would be, among other things, efficient, accurate , precise, and universally applicable to representation of words, ideally usable as a " phonetic distance " metric for direct measurement of the " distance " between word or utterance pairs. None of the proposed models can provide a complete solution to the problem; in general , there is no algorithmic theory of phonetic distance. It is unclear whether this is a weakness of our representational technology or a more fundamental difficulty with the problem statement. In any case, these results show that the representations can be as crucial as the system architecture, and that as much or more creativity is required to properly represent language as to process it.
__label__0, C-Phycocyanin from an acido-thermophilic eukaryotic alga, Cyanidium caldarium, was characterized with respect to subunit structure, absorption spectrum and fluorescence properties and was found to be similar to C-phycocyanins from mesophilic sources. The pH-dependence of fluorescence polarization and the changes in sedimentation velocity as a function of pH, concentration and temperature indicate the presence of extremely large amounts of unusually stable 19S aggregates. It was not possible to disaggregate this phycocyanin completely to monomer under normal conditions. The amino acid composition is similar to that of phycocyanins from other thermophilic and halophilic sources. The isoelectric point of this C-phycocyanin was 5.11, an unusually high value. The properties of this C-phycocyanin suggest an increase in protein stability as its mode of adaptation to the environmental stress of high temperature.
__label__0, We study the dynamics of a classical nonrelativistic charged particle moving on a punctured plane under the influence of a homogeneous magnetic field and driven by a periodically time-dependent singular flux tube through the hole. We observe an effect of resonance of the flux and cyclotron frequencies. The particle is accelerated to arbitrarily high energies even by a flux of small field strength which is not necessarily encircled by the cyclotron orbit; the cyclotron orbits blow up and the particle oscillates between the hole and infinity. We support this observation by an analytic study of an approximation for small amplitudes of the flux which is obtained with the aid of averaging methods. This way we derive asymptotic formulas that are afterwards shown to represent a good description of the accelerated motion even for fluxes which are not necessarily small. More precisely, we argue that the leading asymptotic terms may be regarded as approximate solutions of the original system in the asymptotic domain as the time tends to infinity.
__label__0, We consider the two-encoder multiterminal source coding problem subject to distortion constraints computed under logarithmic loss. We provide a single-letter description of the achievable rate distortion region for arbitrarily correlated sources with finite alphabets. In doing so, we also give the rate distortion region for the CEO problem under logarithmic loss. Notably, the Berger-Tung inner bound is tight in both settings.
__label__0, Temporary epicardial pacing wires during open-heart surgery are routinely used both for diagnostic and treatment purposes. In complicated cases where patients are unstable or the wires are difficult to remove, the pacing wires are cut at the skin level and allowed to retract by themselves. This procedure rarely causes complications. However, there have been cases reporting that retained pacing wires are linked to the formation of sterno-bronchial fistulae, which may present a while after the date of operation and are usually infected. This review aims to study the cases presenting sterno-bronchial fistulae due to retained epicardial pacing wires and to highlight the important factors associated with these. It is important to note these complications, as fistulae may cause a variety of problems to the patient if undiagnosed and left untreated. With the aid of scans such as fistulography, fistulae can be identified and treated and will improve the patients' health dramatically.
__label__0, The German Microcensus The Microcensus is the biggest continuing survey in Germany. Conducted annually since 1957 by the Federal Statistical Office, it samples one percent of all German households or approximately 820.000 people. The main topics of the Microcensus are occupation and qualification, labor markets and household and family structures. Every four years the Microcensus contains additional questions about health or housing conditions, for example. The large sample size and the broad scope of topics make the Microcensus an invaluable data source for different scientific questions of varying complexity. For example, the Microcensus enables one to examine higher education among relatively small groups of immigrants, e.g. Italians or Greeks.
__label__0, The upheaval in the General Medical Council two decades ago came from doctors not the consumers the council was set up to protect. Since then there have been repeated calls for doctors to improve their self regulation by amending the disciplinary procedures. Private member's bills have failed and the GMC has now proposed performance procedures to deal with doctors who exhibit a "pattern of poor performance." After months of wide consultation in and outside the medical profession the GMC will decide next week whether to endorse the procedures, which unlike the conduct hearings will be inquiries by peers. Professor Margaret Stacey suggests that the procedures lack clarity, smacking of that "trust me" principle whose subtext is "but I'm not telling you what I'm up to."
__label__0, The withdrawal of all nourishment and hydration from a patient who had suffered severe brain damage as a result of a cardiorespiratory arrest was recently held by a Californian court of appeal not to constitute an unlawful killing. The possible implications of this decision, both at common law and under the various criminal codes in Australia, are considered.

__label__0, Conducting disks rotating at high speed were used to concentrate flux between the poles of an electromagnet, thereby generating a strong local magnetic field. While the disks are in motion between the magnet poles, the eddy currents generated have an asymmetrical distribution, which was calculated by numerical methods. These currents prevent penetration of the disks by the flux, which instead is concentrated in the space between the disks. Operating characteristics of such a device, and the relationships of the flux density to magnetomotive force while the disks are rotating and at rest, are given.
__label__0, Vomiting or its lesser stages-anorexia, nausea-is a prime symptom of the most serious surgically curable diseases of childhood. In the newborn, when vomitus is green, abdomen scaphoid, and erect roentgen view shows air-fluid levels in stomach and duodenum with gas beyond, partial duodenal obstruction is present and midgut volvulus with malrotation is likely enough to justify immediate exploration. In infancy, vomiting is a clear sign of intussusception when associated with intermittent colicky pain, palpable mass and "currant-jelly" feces. These symptoms are not always present, and if there is blood in the feces, barium enema study must follow. In further doubt, exploration may be justified. In childhood, a common early symptom of appendicitis is vomiting accompanied by pain without any complete remission. Constipation is frequent but diarrhea may occur and contribute to an impression of gastroenteritis. Complete and repeated physical examination, with a history of the above symptoms, should lead to correct diagnosis.

__label__0, The process of reactivation of acid-inactivated alpha-amylase of Bacillus subtilis in weakly alkaline media was examined. The reactivation of alpha-amylase immobilized on carboxyl polyelectrolytes developed in a larger measure than that of the native enzyme. The stabilizing effect of the cross polymer decreased as its porosity increased.
__label__0, In this paper, a distributed algorithm for localization and tracking in wireless sensor network is designed and implemented. Combining the fingerprint approach and subgradient optimization, the proposed algorithm, called golf algorithm, uses different strategies to attain fast movement for tracking a moving object and a fine tune to approach a stationary object, like a drive and a putt on the putting green in the golf. Based on the WLS objective function, a recursive form for both the fingerprint approach and subgradient optimization is derived and can be accomplished by anchor nodes in collaboration. From simulation results, we can see the proposed algorithm has better estimation performance than the conventional decentralized algorithms to localize a stationary or moving target in large wireless sensor networks. In addition, its hardware architecture is designed. The CORDIC operation is employed to compute the vector norm. Parallel processing is used to handle the calculation of fingerprint data. The tracking trajectories of the floating-point program and fixed-point hardware implementation are shown to be quite similar with small finite precision effect, which verifies the feasibility of this hardware solution.
__label__0, This paper presents a simple lightweight Case tool to support manipulation of UML sequence diagrams. The tool is intended to have high usability to facilitate communication and discussion in the early part of the design process, where sequence diagrams are frequently used to explore and explain object interaction. The tool is web-based to maximise accessibility and use by teams, and uses a simple yet effective image tiling technology to allow manipulation of the diagrams from any web browser.
__label__0, The role of surgery in the management of gestational trophoblastic neoplasms has changed over the years and warrants continuous re-evaluation. Surgical removal of the bulk of the disease in an attempt to shorten the hospital course and decrease the amount of chemotherapy required appears to be of value. This approach to therapy should therefore be considered in most patients with nonmetastatic disease without regard to the histologic diagnosis if they have completed their families. "Debulking" of primary uterine disease in the presence of metastases may decrease the chemotherapy necessary for cure and removes a potential source of resistant disease. Pulmonary surgery improves survival rates for patients with a solitary, resistant lung tumor and is advisable under the circumstances outlined herein. Craniotomy is rarely of value in the management of tumor in the brain but may be necessary in emergency situations caused by intracerebral hemorrhage. Surgery to control complications of the disease has been proved to be safe with acceptable morbidity even if performed during chemotherapy. Thus, although chemotherapy has replaced surgery as the primary management of patients with gestational trophoblastic disease, there remain a significant number of patients in whom surgery plays a significant role.
__label__0, We consider concurrent games played on graphs. At every round of a game, each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the safety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the reachability objective to reach a given set of states. We present in this paper a strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety game, that is, the maximal probability with which player 1 can enforce the safety objective. The algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the safety game.    Our result is significant because the strategy improvement algorithm provides, for the first time, a way to approximate the value of a concurrent safety game from below. Since a value iteration algorithm, or a strategy improvement algorithm for reachability games, can be used to approximate the same value from above, the combination of both algorithms yields a method for computing a converging sequence of upper and lower bounds for the values of concurrent reachability and safety games. Previous methods could approximate the values of these games only from one direction, and as no rates of convergence are known, they did not provide a practical way to solve these games.

__label__0, Economic evaluation has become an integral component of health service research in recent years and will no doubt become more influential. As resources are reduced in health services, more questions are likely to be asked on the costs and benefits of new treatments. Questions are also likely to be aimed at treatments that are currently provided. Economics related to health care is complex and numerous methods of economic evaluation exist. Full economic evaluation involves the assessment of both costs and outcomes and is ideal for comparing the efficiency of treatments. Partial evaluations can also provide useful information on the contribution of component costs to treatment costs as a whole. The aim of this review is to assess the various methods available to evaluate the economics of health care and to place in context how these methods may be used within dentistry.
__label__0, Accurate estimation of camera motion is very important for many robotics applications involving SfM and visual SLAM. Such accuracy is attempted by refining the estimated motion through nonlinear optimization. As many modern robots are equipped with both 2D and 3D cameras, it is both highly desirable and challenging to exploit data acquired from both modalities to achieve a better localization. Existing refinement methods, such as Bundle adjustment and loop closing, may be employed only when precise 2D-to-3D correspondences across frames are available. In this paper, we propose a framework for robot localization that benefits from both 2D and 3D information without requiring such accurate correspondences to be established. This is carried out through a 2D-3D based initial motion estimation followed by a constrained nonlinear optimization for motion refinement. The initial motion estimation finds the best possible 2D-to-3D correspondences and localizes the cameras with respect the 3D scene. The refinement step minimizes the projection errors of 3D points while preserving the existing relationships between images. The problems of occlusion and that of missing scene parts are handled by comparing the image-based reconstruction and 3D sensor measurements. The effect of data inaccuracies is minimized using an M-estimator based technique. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed framework allows to obtain a good initial motion estimate and a significant improvement through refinement.
__label__0, The aim of this study was to measure vibrotactile sensitivity and stress pattern recognition of untrained normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects. Vibrotactile thresholds were measured as a function of frequency with two vibrators at three body placements. Stress pattern recognition was tested with two vibrators at two body placements. Vibrotactile threshold results indicate that wrist placements were less sensitive than fingertip placement and the hearing-impaired subjects were equally or less sensitive than the normal-hearing subjects. Vibrator plunger size had the greatest effect on threshold in the most sensitive frequency range of the skin. Stress pattern recognition results indicate that subject performance is a function of body placement but not a function of plunger size. Moreover, stress pattern recognition curves obtained in this study had lower plateaus for the hearing-impaired subjects than for the normal-hearing subjects. Implications for vibrotactile training are discussed.
__label__0, This article studies the problem of assessing relevance to each of the rules of a reference resolution system. The reference solver described here stems from a formal model of reference and is integrated in a reference processing workbench. Evaluation of the reference resolution is essential, as it enables differential evaluation of individual rules. Numerical values of these measures are given, and discussed, for simple selection rules and other processing rules; such measures are then studied for numerical parameters.
__label__0,     In this paper we describe asprin, a general, flexible, and extensible framework for handling preferences among the stable models of a logic program. We show how complex preference relations can be specified through user-defined preference types and their arguments. We describe how preference specifications are handled internally by so-called preference programs, which are used for dominance testing. We also give algorithms for computing one, or all, optimal stable models of a logic program. Notably, our algorithms depend on the complexity of the dominance tests and make use of multi-shot answer set solving technology.   
__label__0, We expound on the impact of extra sterile species on the ultra high energy neutrino fluxes in neutrino telescopes. We use three types of well-known flux ratios and compare the values of these flux ratios in the presence of sterile neutrinos, with those predicted by deviation from the tribimaximal mixing scheme. We show that in the upcoming neutrino telescopes, it is easy to confuse the signature of sterile neutrinos with that of the deviation from tribimaximal mixing. We also show that if the measured flux ratios acquire a value well outside the range predicted by the standard scenario with three active neutrinos only, it might be possible to tell the presence of extra sterile neutrinos by observing ultra high energy neutrinos in future neutrino telescopes.
__label__0, The standard pipeline approach to semantic processing, in which sentences are morphologically and syntactically resolved to a single tree before they are interpreted, is a poor fit for applications such as natural language interfaces. This is because the environment information, in the form of the objects and events in the application's runtime environment, cannot be used to inform parsing decisions unless the input sentence is semantically analyzed, but this does not occur until after parsing in the single-tree semantic architecture. This paper describes the computational properties of an alternative architecture, in which semantic analysis is performed on all possible interpretations during parsing, in polynomial time.
__label__0, Reflection is a widely-used tool in education and practice for giving individuals insight into events and incidents. Case reports, though lacking in rigour as a source of evidence, also provide an opportunity to reflect on and examine practice. They therefore provide a useful opportunity of examining practice in wound care, which is lacking in many nursing curricula. A case report is given here to illustrate some of the lessons that can be learned by reflection--even by an experienced nurse.
__label__0, Introduction A constant search has been going on in order to attempt to establish the metabolic basis of disturbances of the central nervous system characterized clinically by mental retardation. In addition to the now well-studied syndrome of phenylketonuria, a number of conditions such as maple syrup urine disease and Hartnup disease have been detected by the examination of urine and serum for the appearance of increased amounts of certain amino acids. Two-dimensional paper chromatography provides a relatively simple method of carrying out surveys of large numbers of mentally retarded patients in order to discover the presence of hitherto unsuspected aminoacidurias in patients whose disorder is classified as idiopathic mental retardation. The present study describes such a survey of patients with a well-documented familial history of idiopathic mental retardation institutionalized at the Winfield State Hospital and Training Center in Winfield, Kan. Material Eighty-seven patients were selected for examination, of which 66
__label__0, Twenty patients with basilar artery occlusion and three patients with bilateral vertebral artery occlusions have been studied. The clinical data at the time of the ictus and the long-term follow-up data have been correlated with the site and extent of the basilar artery occlusion and the type of collateral flow. Patients with hypertension and with coma at the outset have a grave prognosis. The presence of surface collateral flow may not indicate adequate perfusion of the paramedian penetrating branches of the basilar artery or the thalamoperforating branches of the posterior communicating or posterior cerebral arteries. It is these vessels which supply the territory regulating the level of consciousness and containing some of the control mechanisms for respiratory function.
__label__0, We rephrase the problem of 3D reconstruction from images in terms of intersections of projections of orbits of custom built Lie groups actions. We then use an algorithmic method based on moving frames "a la Fels-Olver" to obtain a fundamental set of invariants of these groups actions. The invariants are used to define a set of equations to be solved by the points of the 3D object, providing a new technique for recovering 3D structure from motion.
__label__0, We describe a method of constructing a sequence of phase coded waveforms with perfect autocorrelation in the presence of Doppler shift. The constituent waveforms are Golay complementary pairs which have perfect autocorrelation at zero Doppler but are sensitive to nonzero Doppler shifts. We extend this construction to multiple dimensions, in particular to radar polarimetry, where the two dimensions are realized by orthogonal polarizations. Here we determine a sequence of two-by-two Alamouti matrices where the entries involve Golay pairs and for which the sum of the matrix-valued ambiguity functions vanish at small Doppler shifts. The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence plays a key role in the construction of Doppler resilient sequences of Golay pairs.
__label__0, Overshoot, settling and rise time define the timing parameters of a control system. The main challenge is to attempt to reduce these parameters to achieve good control performances. The target is to obtain the optimal timing values. In this paper, three different approaches are presented to improve the control performances of second order control systems. The first approach is related to the design of a PID controller based on Ziegler-Nichols tuning formula. An optimal fuzzy controller optimized through Genetic Algorithms represents the second approach. Following this way, the best membership functions are chosen with the help of the darwinian theory of natural selection. The third approach uses the neural networks to achieve adaptive neuro-fuzzy controllers. In this way, the fuzzy controller assumes self-tuning capability. The results show that the designed PID controller has a very slow rise time. The genetic-fuzzy controller gives good values of overshoot and settling time. The best global results are achieved by neuro-fuzzy controller which presents good values of overshoot, settling and rise time. Moreover, our neuro-fuzzy controller improves the results of some conventional PID and fuzzy controllers.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose is a guidance service conducted for the treatment of diabetes performed by medical technologists. This approach is effective in motivating patients to perform self-control, and guidance that is useful for the improvement of patients' lifestyle as well as instruction of the operation of measurement apparatus is required. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to give a guidance in stages corresponding to the condition of the patient. Medical technologists will be able to participate in team treatment of diabetes by giving such guidance.

__label__0, In this paper, we propose a system for automatic judgment of offsides in soccer games. We detect and track players in fixed multi camera images and calculate the world coordinates of them. Furthermore, we do a formation analysis by classifying uniforms and calculate the position of an offside line. On the other hand, we calculate the 3D coordinates and the trajectories of a ball in world coordinates from the plane coordinates of a ball in multi cameras and recognize the moment of a play from the 3D trajectories of a ball. In addition, we make a judge player's interfering with play by analyzing the spatial relationship between a ball and players. Finally, we make an offside judgment by integrating these results. We apply our system to a real soccer match and demonstrate the availability of this system by showing the experimental results
__label__0, A wide variety of noncytotoxic drugs, including antibiotics, analgesics, narcotics, and psychotrophic and cardiovascular agents, may cause lung injury accompanied by roentgenographic infiltrates. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced lung disease are protean. Patients may present with acute injury resembling the adult respiratory distress syndrome, which must initially be distinguished from bacterial sepsis. Other drug-associated lung injury is characterized by a more subacute pneumonitis similar to an atypical infectious pneumonia. Finally, some drugs may cause insidiously progressive pulmonary infiltrates that share features with granulomatous infections. The more common drug reactions are discussed in this review, and, although the features of drug-induced lung disease are often relatively nonspecific, those features that either mimic infectious causes or may be helpful in differentiating these processes from infections are given particular emphasis.

Based on the theory of market orientation MO and the institution-based perspective, this paper investigates the effect of MO on supply chain integration SCI in e-business and examines the moderating role of ownership type in the relationship between MO and SCI in China. The results of a survey of 229 firms suggest that the MO dimensions have different effects on the supply and the demand process integration in e-business. Moreover, ownership type moderates the relationship between MO and SCI. Implications and suggestions for future research are likewise discussed.

__label__0, This paper deals with the analysis of broadcast soccer video. To recognize interesting events such as a goal, estimation of ball movements is necessary. It is, however, sometimes difficult to detect a ball by a simple color and shape-based method when it overlaps with players and lines. We therefore develop a method of estimating a ball route during such overlaps by considering spatio-temporal relationships between players, lines, and the ball. The method can deal with difficult cases such as the one where a ball disappears at a player and re-appears from another player. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the method
__label__0, IS success is a complex concept, and its evaluation is complicated, unstructured and not readily quantifiable. Numerous scientific publications address the issue of success in the IS field as well as in other fields. But, little efforts have been done for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. This paper shows a formal method for mapping success using Neutrosophic Success Map. This is an emerging tool for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. EIS success have been analyzed using this tool.
__label__0, Uncertain phenomenon is prevalent in batch processes, which makes it very difficult to obtain a satisfied schedule for the decision maker with usual deterministic model. In order to improve the system performance in the face of uncertainty, a novel robust scheduling method based on the idea of robust optimization with recourse is proposed. The corn of this method is to find the equilibrium of feasibility and optimization by recourse. Some robust metrics are introduced and proposed to quantify the scheduling robustness. Then a novel robust scheduling model under demand uncertainty is proposed. In this model, some constraints could be violated, but must be compensated to realize robust optimization. Finally the simulation results illustrate the validity of this method
__label__0, A visualization scheme as a tool to find the solution of any 3D-linear programming problem is introduced. The presented approach is highly suitable to draw and visualize interactively the feasible region of a given 3D-linear programming problem. It can be used for a better understanding of the solution process when different methods devoted to solve the underlying problem are applied, e.g., the simplex method. The proposed technique comprises sensitive analysis during the solution process and interactive visualization of the feasible region. The analysis leading to the introduced schema also shows that the design of an appropriate and simple vertex representation is crucial to manage any order of degeneracy. To deal with this paradigm and to some extent to formalize it, the concept of adjacency invariance is introduced. Several experiments have been conducted to test and assess the performance of the introduced concepts and techniques.
__label__0, The challenge of managing unstructured data represents perhaps the largest data management opportunity for our community since managing relational data. And yet we are risking letting this opportunity go by, ceding the playing field to other players, ranging from communities such as AI, KDD, IR, Web, and Semantic Web, to industrial players such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. In this essay we explore what we can do to improve upon this situation. Drawing on the lessons learned while managing relational data, we outline a structured approach to managing unstructured data. We conclude by discussing the potential implications of this approach to managing other kinds of non-relational data, and to the identify of our field.
__label__0, Pulse-width modulated rectifiers are nowadays commonly used for AC to DC power conversion. PWM rectification technology is very effective and allows for bidirectional power flow with the possibility of power factor improvement and low-order harmonic emission limitation. Unfortunately, employed PWM boost topology results with generation of input current harmonic distortions in a frequency range tightly correlated to modulation frequency. PWM carrier frequency and its harmonic components in typical applications are usually located in frequency range from single kHz up to hundreds of kHz. Increase of harmonic emission in this particular frequency range can be disturbing for other sensitive systems, therefore can cause lack of electromagnetic compatibility. Interferences in low frequency range are increasingly frequent EMC issue because of extensive use of low power PWM rectifiers and significant increase of rated power of individual converters, which already reach several MW. Presented comparison of current harmonic emission spectra of PWM rectifiers with relation to classic diode rectifiers is focused on frequency range of 2 to 9 kHz, for which emission limitation rules are currently under development. New class of EMC problems arising in low frequency range in power system are underlined as a result of increased harmonic emission in frequency range of 2 to 9 kHz.

__label__0, The mstE gene encoding a low affinity glucose transporter active during the germination of Aspergillus nidulans conidia on glucose medium has been identified. mstE expression also occurs in hyphae, is induced in the presence of other repressing carbon sources besides glucose, and is dependent on the function of the transcriptional repressor CreA. The expression of MstE and its subcellular distribution have been studied using a MstE-sGFP fusion protein. Concordant with data on mstE expression, MstE-sGFP is synthesized in the presence of repressing carbon sources, and fluorescence at the periphery of conidia and hyphae is consistent with MstE location in the plasma membrane. Deletion of mstE has no morphological phenotype but results in the absence of low affinity glucose uptake kinetics, the latter being substituted by a high affinity system.
__label__0, Lichen planopilaris is a disease that appears with lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia. It is considered a follicular variant of lichen planus. The examination of affected areas shows alopecia with perifollicular erythema and scaling, revealing a predilection for hair follicles. The involvement of children is uncommon, with few reports in this population in the literature. This study presents a clinical case of a male patient of 15 years of age with characteristic lesions of lichen planopilaris.

Small sensitivities to noisy acoustic disturbances of 100 dB intensity in the frequency range of 1-10 kHz that covers resonant frequency have been revealed both for differential and non differential channels of differential vibratory gyro. No any influence on differential CVG output signals under action of periodic acoustic disturbances close to resonant frequency has been revealed.

To better know the scope of arterial hypertension in children in our midst, the authors measured the arterial blood pressure in 8642 Panamanian children between 1 month and 18 years of age and studied the principal causes of arterial hypertension. The authors propose norms for the identification and clinical and pharmacological management of arterial hypertension in Panamanian children.
__label__0, INTRODUCTION We report 3 cases of dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome due to anti-malarial chemoprophylactic treatment with maloprim, in military servicemen, presenting like a viral exanthem.   CLINICAL PICTURE Three male military recruits presented with fever and rash, 6 to 8 weeks after commencing on weekly doses of maloprim.   TREATMENT A course of topical and systemic corticosteroids and oral antihistamines were started.   OUTCOME All cases showed gradual resolution of fever, rash and eventual normalisation of liver function test.   CONCLUSION A high index of suspicion was required before this uncommon syndrome can be recognised. Early institution of corticosteroid therapy and discontinuation of maloprim are the mainstays of treatment.
__label__0, As the memory bottleneck problem continues to grow, so does the relevance of the techniques that help improve program locality. A well-known technique in this category is tiling, which decomposes data sets to be used several times in a computation into a series of tiles that are reused before proceeding to process the next tile. This way, capacity misses are avoided. Finding the optimal tile size is a complex task. In this paper we present and compare a series of strategies to search the optimal tile size guided by an analytical model of the whole memory hierarchy and the CPU behavior. Our experiments show that our strategies find better tile sizes than traditional heuristic approaches proposed in the literature while requiring a small compile-time overhead. Iterative compilation can yield better results, but at the expense of very large overheads.
__label__0, The purpose of this communication is to describe two cases of gross foetal abnormaity and to discuss the influence of intra-uterine environment on the development of congenital abnormalities when the contribution of inherited or genetic factors is made known by the co-existence of a genetically similar but normal twin. The anomalies will not be discussed in detail, but some explanation of the mechanismn of their occurrnce will be attempted, since, even if this proves incorrect, it may stimulate useful reonsideration of the problems presented by congenital malformations which now assume such a great importance in practice.
__label__0, Here we have shown that it is possible to modulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions to further adjust the supramolecular helicity by changing the length of an alkyl chain. These modulated supramolecular interactions have been translated to and observed in electrical conductivity, and provide a new pathway to construct a high-performance nanodevice.
__label__0, The identification of vulnerabilities relies on detailed information about the target infrastructure. The gathering of the necessary information is a crucial step that requires an intensive scanning or mature expertise and knowledge about the system even though the information was already available in a different context. In this paper we propose a new method to detect vulnerabilities that reuses the existing information and eliminates the necessity of a comprehensive scan of the target system. Since our approach is able to identify vulnerabilities without the additional effort of a scan, we are able to increase the overall performance of the detection. Because of the reuse and the removal of the active testing procedures, our approach could be classified as a passive vulnerability detection. We will explain the approach and illustrate the additional possibility to increase the security awareness of users. Therefore, we applied the approach on an experimental setup and extracted security relevant information from web logs.

A sensitive thin-layer chromatographic method based on this property has been developed for the determination of cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime, cefmenoxime and ceftizoxime. The detection limits and reliability of the proposed procedure allow the method to be used for the determination of these cephalosporins in therapeutic monitoring.

__label__0, Cationic antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins are a group of naturally occurring antibiotics that can also possess immunomodulatory activities. They are considered a new source of antibiotics for treating infections by bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Members of the genus Burkholderia, which includes various human pathogens, are inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The resistance is several orders of magnitude higher than that of other Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This review summarizes our current understanding of antimicrobial peptide and polymyxin B resistance in the genus Burkholderia. These bacteria possess major and minor resistance mechanisms that will be described in detail. Recent studies have revealed that many other emerging Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens may also be inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins and we propose that Burkholderia sp. are a model system to investigate the molecular basis of the resistance in extremely resistant bacteria. Understanding resistance in these types of bacteria will be important if antimicrobial peptides come to be used regularly for the treatment of infections by susceptible bacteria because this may lead to increased resistance in the species that are currently susceptible and may also open up new niches for opportunistic pathogens with high inherent resistance.
__label__0, A protein is identified by a finite sequence of amino acids, each of them chosen from a set of 20 elements. The Protein Structure Prediction Problem, fundamental for biological and pharmaceutical research, is the problem of predicting the 3D native conformation of a protein, when its sequence of amino acids is known. All current mathematical models of the problem are affected by intrinsic computational limits, and by a disagreement on which is the most reliable energy function to be used. In this paper we present an agent-based framework for ab-initio simulations, composed by different levels of agents. Each amino acid of an input protein is viewed as an independent agent that communicates with the others. These agents are coordinated by strategic and cooperative higher level agents. The framework allows a modular representation of the problem and it is easily extensible for further refinements and for different energy functions. Simulations at this level of abstraction allow fast calculation, distributed on each agent. We provide an implementation using the Linda package of SICStus Prolog, to show the feasibility and the power of the method.
__label__0, High performance computing, storage, visualization, and database infrastructures are increasing geometrically in complexity as scientists move towards grid-based computing. While this is natural, it has the effect of pushing computational capabilities beyond the reach of scientists because of the time needed to harness the infrastructure. Hiding the complexity of networked resources becomes essential if scientists are to utilize them effectively. In this work, we describe our efforts to integrate various computational chemistry components into a scientific computing environment. We briefly describe improvements we have made to individual components of the chemistry environment as well as future directions, followed by a more in-depth discussion of our strategy for integration into a grid workflow environment based on web services, which enables access to remote resources while shielding users from the complexities of the grid infrastructures. A preliminary schema for storing data obtained from computational chemistry calculations is also described.
__label__0, The results of emergency surgical operations carried out on 61 patients with massively beleding duodenal ulcers between the years 1960 and 1969 were reviewed. The most useful diagnostic tool was gastric roentgenography. However, celiac axis arteriography was not in use during this period. The basic procedure carried out was either gastric resection or vagotomy and pyloroplasty. The mortality between the two groups was similar. However, patients more than 60 years of age had a much greater morbidity after gastric resection. Complications were more likely to occur in patients who had a history of chronic ingestion of aspirin prior to the bleeding episode or in whom bleeding from their duodenal ulcer developed while they were recovering from some other surgical procedure.
__label__0, The presence of filamentous fungi in drinking water has become an area worthy of investigation with various studies now being published. The problems associated with fungi include blockage of water pipes, organoleptic deterioration, pathogenic fungi and mycotoxins. Fungal biofilm formation is a less developed field of study. This paper updates the topic and introduces novel methods on fungal biofilm analysis, particularly from work based in Brazil. Further recommendations for standard methodology are provided.
__label__0, Wearable computing devices are gradually becoming common, and head-mounted devices such as Google Glass are already available. These devices present new interaction challenges as the devices are usually small in size, and also the usage environment sets limitations on the available interaction modalities. One potential interaction method could be to use gaze for input and haptics for output with a head-worn device. We built a demonstration system to show how gaze gestures could be used to control a simple information application together with head area haptic feedback for gesture confirmation. The demonstration and experiences of early user studies have shown that users perceive such an input-output combination useful.
__label__0, This work studies the use of architectures that include GPUs to accelerate the most popular benchmarks in the high performance computing field, namely HPL, HPCG and the one used for the Graph500 ranking. Specifically, the installation and configuration of implementations of these benchmarks that are able to exploit the computer power of different massively parallel hardware platforms are discussed in order to provide a helpful insight on these topics to other researchers. The results obtained in the experimental evaluation show the benefits of the use of this kind of hardware architectures in computation-bounded and memory-bounded algorithms.

__label__0, Reproductive function in male rats was studied in 1, 3 and 6 months after X-ray irradiation of doses of 2 and 3 Gy. It has been established that long-term effects of irradiation at a dose of 3 Gy are manifested through decrease in spermatozoa content in the epididymis and reduction of nucleic acid and protein content in the testes. Fertility of male rats under study significantly lowered shortly after irradiation and full recovery of fecundating ability was observed 6 months later. The effect of irradiation with a dose of 2 Gy was less pronounced.
__label__0, This paper summarises the main results of 10 years of research and development in Humanitarian Demining. The Hudem project focuses on mine detection systems and aims at provided different solutions to support the mine detection operations. Robots using different kind of locomotion systems have been designed and tested on dummy minefields. In order to control these robots, software interfaces, control algorithms, visual positioning and terrain following systems have also been developed. Typical data acquisition results obtained during trial campaigns with robots and data acquisition systems are reported. Lessons learned during the project and future work conclude this paper.
__label__0, Aperiodic arrays represent an attractive technology for applications requiring multiple pencil beams or contour beams, such as in radars, satellite communication and mw-sensor systems. These antennas are typically designed to either produce high-directivity beams over a given scan range or a single beam with a specified complex shape. In this manuscript we present a CS approach for the synthesis of a single aperiodic array layout capable of radiating multiple beams with different shapes The approach aims at designing reconfigurable arrays with least number of elements as well as the optimal excitation set for each of the desired beams. Preliminary results for an array providing both pencil and a flattop coverage are presented.
__label__0, We report the case of a 63-year-old male hospitalised for chronic diarrhoea and weight loss of 11 kg within 2 years. The symptoms began after a trip to Thailand. Various investigations were negative and led to the assumption of tropical sprue, which was treated with tetracycline. Within 4 months the malabsorption deteriorated and the patient was readmitted with severe electrolyte imbalance. CT-scan of the abdomen revealed a thickened intestinal wall in the jejunum. Diagnostic laparotomy was performed and, surprisingly, revealed chylascites. Histology in a segment of the jejunum demonstrated intestinal lymphangiectasias as the cause of the malabsorption. These intestinal lymphangiectasias were most probably the sequela of radiotherapy 30 years earlier for testicular teratocarcinoma. Symptomatic therapy with middle chain triglycerides brought about substantially improvement.

__label__0, Cyber data attacks are the worst-case interacting bad data to power system state estimation and cannot be detected by existing bad data detectors. In this paper, we for the first time analyze the likelihood of cyber data attacks by characterizing the actions of a malicious intruder. We propose to use Markov decision process to model an intruder's strategy, where the objective is to maximize the cumulative reward across time.

As it was one of the main causes which led to the failure of implant treatment, its risk factors and treatment were attracting more and more attention. This review summarized the progress of clinical research on peri-implantitis risk factors and treatments.

Sublethal venom doses caused afibrinogenemia, factor V deficiency and thrombocytopenia in the absence of hemorrhage. Early intravascular clotting was observed following injection of high lethal doses of both whole venom and of procoagulant-containing fraction II, but not of fraction I which was devoid of procoagulant activity. The afibrinogenemia produced by fraction I was due to its fibrinogenolysin, whereas the afibrinogenemia produced by fraction II, which also had fibrinogenolytic activity, was due chiefly to its procoagulant. Anti- Echis colorata venom rabbit serum inhibited the fibrinogenolytic, the procoagulant and the thrombocytopenic activities of the venom.
__label__0, Antibody-enzyme conjugates are widely utilized in all spheres of specific analyte detection and measurement, and several trends are evident that will sustain, or even extend, this in the coming years. Of principal importance are the trends toward the development of simplified formats for the rapid and sensitive quantitation of a wide range of analytes without expensive or cumbersome instrumentation, and the exploitation of different types of enzyme and antibody molecules. Advances in hybridoma and recombinant genetics are enabling the practical manipulation of the theoretical repertoire of these reagents, facilitating their availability for a myriad of applications.
__label__0, The number of studies examining how species diversity influences the productivity of ecosystems has increased dramatically in the past decade as concern about global loss of biodiversity has intensified. Research to date has greatly improved our understanding of how, when, and why species loss alters primary production in ecosystems. However, because experiments have been performed at rather small spatial and short temporal scales, it is unclear whether conclusions can be readily extrapolated to the broader scales at which natural communities are most likely to influence ecosystem functioning. Here we develop a simple patch-dynamics model to examine some of the scale-dependent and independent qualities of the diversity-productivity relationship. We first simulate a typical diversity-productivity experiment and show that the influence of species richness on productivity is temporally dynamic, growing stronger through successional time. This holds true irrespective of whether resource partitioning or a sampling effect is the underlying mechanism. We then increase the spatial scale of the simulation from individual patches to a region consisting of many patch types. Results suggest that the diversity-productivity relationship is not influenced by spatial scale per se, but that the mechanism producing the relationship can change from sampling effects within individual patches to resource partitioning across patch types composing the region. This change occurs even though model dynamics are the same at both scales, suggesting that sampling effects and resource partitioning can represent different descriptions of the same biological processes operating concurrently at differing scales of observation. Lastly, we incorporate regional processes of dispersal and disturbance into the model and show that these processes can amplify the effect of species richness on productivity, resulting in patterns not easily anticipated from experiments. We conclude that the relative control of community structure by local versus regional processes may be a primary determinant of the diversity-productivity relationship in natural ecosystems. Therefore, past experiments having focused only on local processes might not reflect patterns and processes underlying diversity-productivity relationships in communities where disturbance and dispersal regulate species biomasses.

__label__0, To address energy constraint problem in sensor networks, node reclamation and replacement strategy has been proposed for networks accessible to human beings and robots. The major challenge in realizing the strategy is how to minimize the system maintenance cost, especially the frequency in replacing sensor nodes with limited number of backup nodes. New duty cycle scheduling schemes are required in order to address the challenge. Tong et al. have proposed a staircase-based scheme to address the problem based on ideal assumptions of sensor nodes that are free of failure and have regular energy consumption rate. Since sensor nodes are often deployed in outdoor unattended environment, node failures are inevitable. Energy consumption rates of sensor nodes are irregular due to manufacture or environmental reasons. Hence, this paper proposes several new schemes to achieve reliable scheduling for node reclamation and replacement. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify that the proposed scheme is effective and efficient.
__label__0, present work a model is proposed which is useful for text summarization of the given document by using pattern recognition techniques for improving the retrieval performance of the relevant information. The design and implementation of the proposed systems is concerned with methods for summarizing of the retrieving information from a collection of documents or corpuses. The quality of a system is measured by how useful it is to the typical users of the system. In the basic approach, a query is considered generated from an "ideal" document that satisfies the information need. The system's job is then to estimate the likelihood of each document in the collection being the ideal document and rank them accordingly. The recent development of related techniques stimulates new modeling and estimation methods that are beyond the scope of the traditional approaches.

__label__0, September 2007 marked the 30-year anniversary of the first human percutaneous coronary intervention, an index event that changed the course of modern-day cardiovascular care. Before that first procedure, adult invasive cardiology focused on diagnostic angiography as well as hemodynamic assessment of structural heart disease. Since that initial procedure, percutaneous coronary intervention has become the most frequently performed coronary revascularization procedure worldwide. Several factors have been responsible for this dramatic paradigm shift, the most prominent being identification of opportunities for technical improvement and the application of innovation and investigation in concert with colleagues, professional societies, and industry. These approaches will continue to be of paramount importance as new technologies are brought to bear on an increasingly broader group of patients with cardiovascular disease.

__label__0, The presence of circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream has been correlated with disease state in cancer patients. While we have successfully exploited melanin, the natural light absorber in melanoma cells, to induce photoacoustic waves for tumor cell detection, non-pigmented tumor cells do not have sufficient optical contrast for such a method. For example, breast, prostate and lung cancers lack intrinsic pigmentation and thus do not generate photoacoustic waves. In order to induce optical contrast in non-pigmented cancer cells, we have attached gold nanoparticles to a prostate cancer cell line. This optical absorption will enable us to detect such cells in a photoacoustic flowmeter designed to find circulating tumor cells in blood samples. We tested a prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, by tagging them with gold nanoparticles. We determined the photoacoustic response over the wavelengths 470-570 nm to identify the absorption peak. We then determined the response from serial dilutions of PC-3 cells suspended in saline. Finally, we showed photoacoustic response from PC-3 cells suspended among white blood cells in the flow meter to demonstrate our ability to detect single cells under flow.

This article details some of these signs and how to document and report them.
__label__0, In this paper we propose a technique to incorporate contextual information into object classification. In the real world there are cases where the identity of an object is ambiguous due to the noise in the measurements based on which the classification should be made. It is helpful to reduce the ambiguity by utilizing extra information referred to as context, which in our case is the identities of the accompanying objects. This technique is applied to white blood cell classification. Comparisons are made against "no context" approach, which demonstrates the superior classification performance achieved by using context. In our particular application, it significantly reduces false alarm rate and thus greatly reduces the cost due to expensive clinical tests.
__label__0, A thorough understanding of the role of human factors in error in health care for improving patient safely is paramount. One area particularly crucial for optimising clinical performance is the recognising the importance of situational awareness. Loss of situation awareness can occur in many different settings, particularly during stressful and unexpected situations. Tunnel vision is a classic example where clinicians focus on one aspect of care, often to the detriment of overall patient management. Loss of situational awareness can result in serious compromise to patient safety if it is not recognised by either the individual or clinical team. We provide an introduction to situational awareness for those not familiar with it, including some important theory which explains how awareness can be lost, and discuss the important approaches we use in our day-to-day practice to safeguard both patients and clinicians in the workplace environment.

In addition, we find indications of a fragile-to-strong transition of hydration water.
__label__0, Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in women. Thermography, which uses cameras with sensitivities in the thermal infrared, has been shown to provide an interesting alternative to the standard modality of mammography for detecting breast cancer as it is able to detect smaller tumors and hence can lead to earlier diagnosis. In this paper, we present an approach to breast thermogram analysis that extracts features describing bilateral symmetries from an image and then utilizes a classifier ensemble for decision making. Importantly, our classification approach addresses the problem of imbalanced class distribution that is common in medical data analysis. We do this by constructing feature subspaces from balanced data subsets and train different classifiers on different subspaces. To combine the individual classifiers, we investigate two different strategies. The first dynamically assigns classifier weights based on an evolutionary algorithm, while the second uses a neural network for classifier fusion. Both approaches are shown to work well and to lead to significantly improved performance compared to canonical classification systems.
__label__0, We give necessary conditions for a two-weight projective cyclic code to be the direct sum of two one-weight irreducible cyclic subcodes of the same dimension, following the work of Wolfmann and Vega.

__label__0, This paper deals with the extension of the Apriori algorithm and of the association rules to the symbolic histogram and interval-valued data. We suggest a method that will enable us to discover rules at the level of the concepts. This extension requires new definitions for the support and the confidence in order to take advantage of the symbolic structure of the data. The market basket data example is developed throughout the paper. Thus, instead of mining rules between different items of some transactions recorded in a retail organization like in the classical case, we discover rules at the level of the customers in order to study their purchase behavior.
__label__0, Many real-world datasets are comprised of different representations or views which often provide information complementary to each other. To integrate information from multiple views in the unsupervised setting, multiview clustering algorithms have been developed to cluster multiple views simultaneously to derive a solution which uncovers the common latent structure shared by multiple views. In this paper, we propose a novel NMFbased multi-view clustering algorithm by searching for a factorization that gives compatible clustering solutions across multiple views. The key idea is to formulate a joint matrix factorization process with the constraint that pushes clustering solution of each view towards a common consensus instead of fixing it directly. The main challenge is how to keep clustering solutions across different views meaningful and comparable. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel and effective normalization strategy inspired by the connection between NMF and PLSA. Experimental results on synthetic and several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

__label__0, This paper provides an overview of research into nurses' experiences of working with cancer, both how nursing care is experienced by people with cancer and the effects on nurses of working in cancer treatment and care settings. The literature, although slim, suggests that the work of nurses is experienced as valuable and supportive, although this is not consistently the case. Although nurses find working with people with cancer rewarding, it is also emotionally demanding. Evidence for stress among nurses working in cancer settings is mixed and may be related to structural factors more than the difficulties of working with patients who may be dying, although this warrants further exploration. Studies of nurses' communication skills are limited by a measurement-orientated approach that measures behaviour against predetermined criteria. Observational studies provide rich insights into the complex relationship between how nurses work with people who have cancer, or who are dying, as they adjust to their predicament, how this is therapeutic, but also where it may go wrong. Little detailed or comparative work has been undertaken into the skills and experiences of nurses working in different roles, in particular those of nurse specialists. Research is needed to further elucidate themes identified, in particular to shed light on how nurses and other health professionals may be assisted to develop expert practice in working with cancer, but also to sustain health professionals in this work.

We propose a content-based recommendation approaches that adapts a spreading activation algorithm over the DBpedia category structure to identify entities of interest to the user. Evaluation of the algorithm over the Movielens dataset demonstrates that our method yields more accurate recommendations compared to a previously proposed taxonomy driven approach for recommendations.

__label__0, Crease surfaces describe extremal structures of 3D scalar fields. We present a new region-growing-based approach to the meshless extraction of adaptive nonmanifold valley and ridge surfaces that overcomes limitations of previous approaches by decoupling point seeding and triangulation of the surface. Our method is capable of extracting valley surface skeletons as connected minimum structures. As our algorithm is inherently mesh-free and curvature adaptive, it is suitable for surface construction in fields with an arbitrary neighborhood structure. As an application for insightful visualization with valley surfaces, we choose a low frequency acoustics simulation. We use our valley surface construction approach to visualize the resulting complex-valued scalar pressure field for arbitrary frequencies to identify regions of sound cancellation. This provides an expressive visualization of the topology of wave node and antinode structures in simulated acoustics.
__label__0, The neurodegenerative diseases are an increasing medical and social burden in developed societies. During the last century, and the early part of this, these diseases were defined and classified as separate clinicopathologic entities. However, during this decade, detailed genetic investigations and the use of molecular pathologic tools have suggested that many of these diseases share common mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here I argue that while these diseases have separate and distinct etiologies, these initiate few pathogenic processes that lead to cell death.
__label__0, Several recent results concerning frequency dependent and nonlinear transport of one-dimensional correlated electrons are reviewed. The frequency dependent conductance of a Luttinger liquid is discussed. For zero-range interaction the conductance is similar to that of a non-interacting ideal quantum wire, with a renormalized zero-frequency limit. For a screened Coulomb potential, the conductance as a function of the frequency shows features of the elementary excitations. They can be simulated in terms of a capacitance, an inductance and a resistance. The non-linear DC-conductance of the Luttinger liquid in presence of a tunnel barrier shows Coulomb blockade if the interaction is of finite range. The capacitance scales in the same way as for the system without the tunnel barrier. The linear DC-response of a tunnel barrier as a function of the frequency and the voltage of a monochromatic driving field shows oscillations which can be interpreted as signature of a frequency-induced depinning of a charge density wave.
__label__0, The problem of computing soft shadows with area light sources has received considerable attention in computer graphics. In part, this is a difficult problem because the integral that defines the radiance at a point must take into account the visibility function. Most of the solutions proposed have been limited to polygonal environments, and require a full visibility determination preprocessing step. The result is typically a partitioning of the environment into regions that have a similar view of the light source. We propose a new approach that can be successfully applied to arbitrary environments. The approach is based on the observation that, in the presence of occluders, the primary difficulty in computing the integral that defines the contribution of an area light source, is that of determining the visible domain of the integrand. We extend a recent shadow algorithm for linear light sources in order to calculate a polygonal approximation to this visible domain. We demonstrate for an important class of shadowing problems, and in particular, for convex occluders, that the shape of the visible domain only needs to be roughly approximated by a polygonal boundary. We then use this boundary to subdivide an area light source into a small number of triangles that can be integrated efficiently using either a deterministic solution, or a low degree numerical cubature.
__label__0, Engineering design is a difficult task. Designers work at the boundaries between physical laws, societal or governmental regulations, the need for efficiency, and the desire to develop creative or aesthetic solutions. Teaching engineering design is therefore a difficult task. How is it possible to stimulate students to think of creative solutions while adhering to established principles and necessary rules? Certainly, it is important for students to have deep-seated roots in engineering fundamentals. These fundamentals include both a strong overall engineering core and coursework specific to the particular branch of engineering study undertaken by the student. For industrial engineers, the study of operations research is fundamental in preparing them for careers in engineering design. This paper addresses one way of encouraging creativity in teaching operations research in industrial engineering design curricula. Specifically, this paper provides examples of the use of games as pedagogical tools in teaching operations research. These games cannot be used as a substitute for teaching practical applications, but they are excellent supplementary tools that encourage students to tackle highly structured problems creatively while working on interesting and enjoyable tasks. Four examples are provided within the paper.

We first parameterize the congestion-controllers using a parameter called the multiplicative decrease parameter and study the adaptation of the congestion-controllers in terms of adapting this parameter. We then linearize the system to study the local stability properties and provide design rules for choosing the parameters of the congestion-controllers. We assume a general network topology and arbitrary round-trip delays in the analysis. Simulations that show the throughput increase that can be achieved using such adaptive congestion-controllers are also presented.

__label__0, Networks of model neurons with balanced recurrent excitation and inhibition produce irregular and asynchronous spiking activity. We extend the analysis of balanced networks to include the known dependence of connection probability on the spatial separation between neurons. In the continuum limit we derive that stable, balanced firing rate solutions require that the spatial spread of external inputs be broader than that of recurrent excitation, which in turn must be broader than or equal to that of recurrent inhibition. For finite size networks we investigate the pattern forming dynamics arising when balanced conditions are not satisfied. The spatiotemporal dynamics of balanced networks offer new challenges in the statistical mechanics of complex systems.
__label__0, The problem of adaptive sliding mode control for a class of uncertain Markovian jump systems with time delay is considered. Under the assumptions of matched known upper bound system uncertainties and unknown upper bound system uncertainties, the sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the mean exponentially stability of reduced-order sliding mode system. Under the assumption of two kind of system uncertainties, conventional sliding mode control law and adaptive sliding mode control law are proposed. The control methods guarantees that the trajectory of system arrives at the sliding surface in finite time interval and is kept here thereafter. Finally, a simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The salient features of such Rhinoliths and their relevance to clinical practice are discussed and a case of a large Rhinolith is presented in this article. So as to enable the attending clinician to be aware of this forgotten entity, which requires a high index of suspicion.
__label__0, The necklace hypercube has recently been introduced as an attractive alternative to the well-known hypercube. Previous research on this network topology has mainly focused on topological properties, VLSI and algorithmic aspects of this network. Several analytical models have been proposed in the literature for different interconnection networks, as the most cost-effective tools to evaluate the performance merits of such systems. This paper proposes an analytical performance model to predict message latency in wormhole-switched necklace hypercube interconnection networks with fully adaptive routing. The analysis focuses on a fully adaptive routing algorithm which has been shown to be the most effective for necklace hypercube networks. The results obtained from simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a good accuracy under different operating conditions.
__label__0, In many areas of science and engineering it is of interest to find the shape of an object or region from indirect measurements which can actually be distilled into moments of the underlying shapes we seek to reconstruct. In this paper, we describe a theoretical framework for the reconstruction of a class of planar semi-analytic domains from their moments. A part of this class, known as quadrature domains, can approximate, arbitrarily closely, any bounded domain in the complex plane, and is therefore of great practical importance. We provide an exact reconstruction algorithm of quadrature domains. Some numerical demonstrations of the proposed algorithms will be presented. In addition, relations of the present theory to computer-assisted tomography and a geophysical inverse problem will be briefly discussed.

We define a game theoretic framework, including possible strategy sets and a game environment. We outline a series of experiments which illustrate the effects of implicit trust. Finally, we draw conclusions based on the experimental results presented.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed compression of the right ventricle by a tumor. At the time of cardiac catheterization, the coronary arteries were found not to supply blood flow of the mass, and no dip-and-plateau pattern was seen in the right ventricular pressure measurements. At the time of surgery, the mass was found to be a focal calcified thickening of the pericardium containing only pus. The thickening resembled an oval pericardial tumor. Microbiologic examination of the pus revealed Propionibacterium acnes.
__label__0, In distributed services shared by multiple tenants, managing resource allocation is an important pre-requisite to providing dependability and quality of service guarantees. Many systems deployed today experience contention, slowdown, and even system outages due to aggressive tenants and a lack of resource management. Improperly throttled background tasks, such as data replication, can overwhelm a system; conversely, high-priority background tasks, such as heartbeats, can be subject to resource starvation. In this paper, we outline five design principles necessary for effective and efficient resource management policies that could provide guaranteed performance, fairness, or isolation. We present Retro, a resource instrumentation framework that is guided by these principles. Retro instruments all system resources and exposes detailed, real-time statistics of pertenant resource consumption, and could serve as a base for the implementation of such policies.

__label__0, Eva Charlotte Reid, San Francisco-In recent years psychiatrists have been eagerly following the developments of endocrinology, hoping that a ray of light might be shed upon the etiology of the psychoses and a scientific line of treatment evolved. So far they appear to have been following a will-o'-the-wisp. Years ago Doctor Southard of Boston predicted "The time is coming when there will be no psychologists and psychiatrists left. The endocrinologist will eliminate us all. He will take all the cases of mental disease, explain them on the basis of misbehaving ductless glands and cure them all." While this golden era seems as yet far distant, endocrinology appears to offer the most reasonable explanation of the psychoses other than those produced by toxins and those associated with organic brain disease. Anyone who has made routine examinations in a large hospital for mental cases cannot but be struck by the frequency with which evidences of endocrinopathies appear,-pseudohermaphroditism, infantile sex organs, menstrual irregularities, adiposities, faulty skeletal development, gigantism, absence and irregularity of teeth, and abnormal hair distribution. After years of observation one learns to expect a less hopeful prognosis in cases where these anomalies are most marked. In every state hospital the "residue which remains" is composed largely of these anomalous individuals. It was doubtless the prominence of these defects especially in dementia praecox that form seventy-five per cent of these cases, which led Adler to formulate his theory of organ inferiority, namely that a badly constructed body expresses itself at the psychological level in defects of adjustment and peculiarities of conduct. In other words, the abnormal conduct is a manifestation of an attempt by the individual to compensate for organ inferiority. Others believe that the trouble is primarily a psychological condition induced by faulty training and environment, and that the mental regression reacts upon the physical organism. It is more reasonable to suppose that both the organic and psychological are manifestations of an inherent development anomaly. For the past ten years Mott of London has been carrying on pathological investigations on the ductless glands of mental cases. He claims to have discovered changes in the gonads, pituitary and adrenal glands which appear to be pathognomic of dementia praecox. Other investigators, with the exception of Lewin of Washington, D. C., have been unable to confirm these findings. In the November number of the Ameri-

With widely-deployed Wi-Fi infrastructure, modern people can enjoy a variety of online services such as web browsing, online shopping, social interaction, and e-commerce almost at any time and any place. Traditionally, the most significant functionality of Wi-Fi is to enable high-throughput data communication between terminal devices and the Internet. However, beyond that, we observe that a novel type of system based on commodity Wi-Fi is increasingly attracting intense academic interest. Without hardware modification and redeployment, researchers are exploiting channel state information output by commodity Wi-Fi and transforming existing Wi-Fi systems into radar-like ones that can recognize human behavior along with data communication. This fancy functionality is tremendously expanding the boundaries of Wi-Fi to a new realm and triggering revolutionary applications in the context of the Internet of Things. In this article, we provide a guide to and introduce the impressive landscape of this new realm.

Based on an established sensory hardware setup, we implemented a robust body tracking system for a large-scaled tabletop. On this basis a user can pan through a spatial user interface by adjusting her position at the table. As a natural form of interaction, this technique is convenient and applicable to many existing use cases and applic's navigational and spatial memory performance. We conducted an experiment between a common touch panning and a body panning interface to find out about differences in these performances. For the body panning condition, we observed an increased spatial memory performance and an invariant navigation performance. We present and discuss these results focusing on application domains for the body panning technique.

Existing cross layer architecture either adopts a specific MAC for an application type or does not change the MAC behavior because the MAC is commonly used for all types of applications in a node. MAC virtualization is an appropriate method to associate the MAC behavior with a specific application's requirement without impacting on other types of application. In this paper, we propose a partial MAC virtualization to support cross layer design in wireless ad hoc networks. In the proposed scheme, a MAC scheme is divided into a set of controllable condition variables and common MAC executor. A MAC control manager generates a virtual MAC with a set of controllable condition variables and related state variables. This paper also proposes an interface through which an application or an agent of the application can control the MAC for its own purpose, which allows a cross-layer mechanism for each application in a node. We show the feasibility of the proposed scheme by an example and experiments.
__label__0, In this paper, a control system is designed that synchronizes the motions of biaxial positioning tables. The control system consists of nonlinear feedback laws of the displacements and the velocities of the table along its axes. The designed control system successfully generates desired contours on the workpiece by synchronizing the motions of the biaxial table along its axes, and compensates for the effects of parametric uncertainty and disturbance to the system.
__label__0, A case of a 50-year female patient with Raynaud's disease is presented. The primary pulmonary hypertension accompanying the underlying condition suggests that the excessive contractibility of the vessels, typical for the Raynaud's disease, may play a role in the etiology of the primary pulmonary hypertension.
__label__0, The search for relevant information is often hindered by the initial difficulty in formulating precise requests, and because much knowledge is actually tacit and thus not easily accessible. Asking for human assistance is the usual response to these problems, but one can develop computer systems to help locate the right persons in the search for information. We will describe the structure and functioning of a collaborative, distributed search system designed to emulate the information-gathering functions of social communities. Such systems can be used to create virtual communities as well as to improve information retrieval. Potential benefits and likely problems of this approach will also be discussed.
__label__0, Converting information contained in natural language clinical text into computer-amenable structured representations can automate many clinical applications. As a step towards that goal, we present a method which could help in converting novel clinical phrases into new expressions in SNOMED CT, a standard clinical terminology. Since expressions in SNOMED CT are written in terms of their relations with other SNOMED CT concepts, we formulate the important task of identifying relations between clinical phrases and SNOMED CT concepts. We present a machine learning approach for this task and using the dataset of existing SNOMED CT relations we show that it performs well.
__label__0, We study the amplification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations induced by the evolution of scalar metric perturbations at the end of inflation. Such perturbations break the conformal invariance of Maxwell equations in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds and allow the growth of magnetic fields on super-Hubble scales. We relate the strength of the fields generated by this mechanism with the power spectrum of scalar perturbations and estimate the amplification on galactic scales for different values of the spectral index. Finally we discuss the possible effects of finite conductivity during reheating.
__label__0, A population survey in northern Liberia showed an average incidence of 9 percent of beta-thalassaemia trait. There was considerable tribal variation, the highest rates being mainly found in tribes having a low incidence of Hb S. A single example of deltabeta-thalassaemia trait was also found; the incidence of delta-chain variants was 1.8 percent. The effect of malaria on Hb A2 levels was investigated but appeared to be negligible. The problems of beta-thalassaemia and Hb S occurring in the same population are discussed. It is considered that, although made on a local sample, the results of this survey indicate a high incidence of beta-thalassaemia trait elsewhere in Liberia and that this is a suitable are for investigations of linkage at beta- and delta-chain loci. No conclusion is at present possible from the data on the presence of alpha-thalassaemia although 10 percent of neonates were found to have increased levels of Hb Barts.
__label__0, In this column, the authors summarize four research studies that further support the benefits of normal birth. The topics of the studies include the association of cesarean birth with an increased risk of neonatal death; the use of acupuncture and self-hypnosis as effective pain-management strategies; factors associated with amniotic-fluid embolism; and the positive influence of continuous support by lay doulas on obstetric outcomes for low-income women.
__label__0, Inferring the nature and magnitude of selection is an important problem in many biological contexts. Typically when estimating a selection coefficient for an allele, it is assumed that samples are drawn from a panmictic population and that selection acts uniformly across the population. However, these assumptions are rarely satisfied. Natural populations are almost always structured, and selective pressures are likely to act differentially. Inference about selection ought therefore to take account of structure. We do this by considering evolution in a simple lattice model of spatial population structure. We develop a hidden Markov model based maximum-likelihood approach for estimating the selection coefficient in a single population from time series data of allele frequencies. We then develop an approximate extension of this to the structured case to provide a joint estimate of migration rate and spatially varying selection coefficients. We illustrate our method using classical data sets of moth pigmentation morph frequencies, but it has wide applications in settings ranging from ecology to human evolution.
__label__0, We report the generation of 30 microJ single-cycle terahertz pulses at 100 Hz repetition rate by phase-matched optical rectification in lithium niobate using 28 mJ femtosecond laser pulses. The phase-matching condition is achieved by tilting the laser pulse intensity front. Temporal, spectral, and propagation properties of the generated terahertz pulses are presented. In addition, we discuss possibilities for further increasing the energy of single-cycle terahertz pulses obtained by optical rectification.
__label__0, 3 stenosis of the bile duct were observed in a postoperative study out of 25 patients, who underwent operations of the bile-duct-system and had T-tubes. These patients had no complaints. One patient had a reanastomosis of the bile duct, the stenosis was in the area of the anastomosis. The T-tubes of 2 patients were postoperatively under traction, which might have favoured the stenosis. The possibilities of intravenous cholangiography and endoscopic-retrograde cholangiography are discussed.
__label__0, Abstract Blunt trauma to the temporal region can cause fracture of the skull base, loss of hearing, vestibular symptoms and otorrhoea. The most common causes of blunt trauma to the ear and surrounding area are motor vehicle accidents, violent encounters, and sports-related accidents. We present an obscure case of a man who was struck in the ear by a flying fish while wading in the sea with resulting temporal bone fracture, sudden deafness, vertigo, cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea, and pneumocephalus.
__label__0, Class AB amplifier is widely used as analog building blocks for many applications. The recent development of class AB amp for low power and low voltage applications is reviewed and summarized. A low noise design realization is fabricated in 0.35 um CMOS technology. For 10pF cap load, it shows GBW of 800KHz with supply voltage of 2.5V and about 5uA quiescent current.1
__label__0, In this data snapshot, the IMS PharMetrics Database was examined to assess the prevalence of combination antipsychotic therapy for the years 2003 through 2009 among 122,349 commercially insured adult individuals with bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophrenia. Although all three diagnostic groups were associated with varying amounts of combination antipsychotic use that included aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, persons with schizophrenia exhibited the highest rates. These findings indicate that from the perspective of "practice-based evidence," providers see value in combination therapy.

__label__0, The authors present modified Denis's technique for hemostasis in 20 suprapubic prostatectomy. The technique is based on the separation between the bladder and the prostatic fossa with a temporary purse-string suture around the bladder neck. The vacuum of the prostatic fossa leads to the retraction and hemostatis. This technique is very effective on intra and post operative hemorrhage, so economy of irrigating fluid; then easier post operative care.
__label__0, Current standard interfaces for entering mathematical equations on computers are arguably limited and cumbersome. Mathematics notations have evolved to aid visual thinking and yet text-based interfaces relying on keyboard-and-mouse input do not take advantage of the natural two-dimensional aspects of math. Due to its similarities to paper-based mathematics, pen-based handwriting input may be faster, more efficient, and more preferable for entering mathematics on computers. This paper presents an empirical study that tests this hypothesis. We also explored a multimodal input method combining handwriting and speech because we hypothesize that it may enhance computer recognition and aid user cognition. Novice users were indeed faster, more efficient and enjoyed the handwriting modality more than a standard keyboard-and-mouse mathematics interface, especially as equation length and complexity increased. The multimodal handwriting-plus-speech method was faster and better liked than the keyboard-and-mouse method and was not much worse than handwriting alone.
__label__0, Power amplifiers, an integral component to most wireless communication systems, are inherently nonlinear devices that introduce out-of-band spectral regrowth and constellation degradation to the amplifier output. One solution is to operate in a highly backed-off state to achieve quasi-linear performance. Operating in this region requires a higher-saturated power rating for a given output power and reduces DC-to-RF efficiency. A more effective solution is to apply digital predistortion which pre-compensates for the harmful nonlinear effects. A common framework for identifying the predistortion system is known as the indirect learning architecture. A single iteration of this architecture, i.e. a one-step approach, demonstrates performance improvement. We propose an multi- iteration approach to the indirect learning architecture that demonstrates additional improvement, as exhibited by three different algorithms shown to be effective at identifying a predistorter.
__label__0, In a 6-year cover crop sequence study, nematode population densities varied with different cover crops. Millet favored rapid increase of Belonolaimus longicaudatus and supported relatively large numbers of Pratylenchus brachyurus. Beggarweed and 'Coastal' bermudagrass favored rapid increase of B. Iongicaudatus and to a lesser extent P. brachyurus and Trichodorus christiei. Hairy indigo and Crotalaria supported relatively large numbers of P. brachyurus but suppressed B. longicaudatus. Hairy indigo also supported increases of T. christiei and Xiphinema americanum. Marigold did not favor development of any parasitic nematode species present. Tomato transplant yield was inversely related to nematode population, particularly to B. Iongicaudatus. Largest yields were obtained from plots with smallest numbers of B. longicaudatus and smallest yields were from plots with largest numbers of B. longicaudatus.
__label__0, The study of growth and development of the facial profile is of interest to clinicians and researchers in the fields of pediatric dentistry, orthodontics, and craniofacial surgery, enabling diagnosis, planning, and evaluation of treatment. Until recently, craniofacial studies addressed facial growth, facial asymmetry, and gender differences by examining changes in size. However, size changes alone do not represent fully the complicated process of craniofacial growth which also involves changes in shape. The shape of the facial profile can now be quantified with Fourier analysis, contributing to a better understanding of growth. A combination of recently developed methods, such as 3-dimensional facial morphometry and Fourier analysis, should allow a more comprehensive knowledge of growth and development of the craniofacial structures, including the facial profile. This article examines various methods for assessing facial growth and development currently available with particular reference to the facial profile, and addresses the value of Fourier analysis in assessing shape changes.
__label__0, Many parents of children with severe physical and mental deficits appear to be in conflict between two ambivalent emotions, wanting to live with their child and needing to be relieved from their child's constant suffering. This internal struggle may become a life-long "grief-relief process" for the parents that is manageable but unresolved. The emotional conflict may result in a subconscious or conscious death wish for the child. The conflict reaches its peak when etiology, surgery, and prognosis are discussed and when the child dies. It has been noted that with the death of the child there may be a rapid movement from grief to a sense of relief. This has been referred to as the "grief-relief phenomenon." Though relief appears soon, the period of bereavement may be long and painful. Consequently, the importance of long-term follow-up has been emphasized. Practical suggestions have been offered to allied health professionals working with these parents on a daily basis. This article has concerned itself primarily with the emotional adjustment of parents to children with severe deficits. The grief-relief phenomenon may also be applicable in relation to other populations, such as elderly or terminally ill patients who are constantly in pain and suffering.
__label__0, This paper illustrates the use of mathematical programming in computing gradient estimators. Consistency property of these estimators is established under the usual assumptions for IPA gradient estimator consistency. A finite difference tolerance limit is introduced. For complex discrete-event systems, more concise linear programming representations are developed. These new representations provide a direct way of calculating gradient estimates.
__label__0, In earlier studies it was shown that the mammalian translation system is highly organized in vivo and that the intermediates in the process, aminoacyl-tRNAs, are channeled--i.e., they are directly transferred from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to the elongation factor to the ribosomes without dissociating into the cellular fluid. Here, we examine whether spent tRNAs leaving the ribosome enter the fluid phase or are transferred directly to their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to complete a channeled tRNA cycle. Using a permeabilized CHO cell system that closely mimics living cells, we find that there is no leakage of endogenous tRNA during many cycles of translation, and protein synthesis remains linear during this period, even though free aminoacyl-tRNA is known to rapidly equilibrate between the inside and outside of these cells. We also find that exogenous tRNA and periodate-oxidized tRNA have no effect on protein synthesis in this system, indicating that they do not enter the translation machinery, despite the fact that exogenous tRNA rapidly distributes throughout the cells. Furthermore, most of the cellular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases function only with endogenous tRNAs, although a portion can use exogenous tRNA molecules. However, aminoacylation of these exogenous tRNAs is strongly inhibited by oxidized tRNA; this inhibitor has no effect on endogenous aminoacylation. On the basis of these and the earlier observations, we conclude that endogenous tRNA is never free of the protein synthetic machinery at any stage of the translation process and, consequently, that there is a channeled tRNA cycle during protein synthesis in mammalian cells.
__label__0, We argue that using information content of individual client requests to distribute load across a cluster of workstations or PCs has many attractive properties, and describe how current Internet standards make content-based load distribution difficult. We discuss several approaches to achieve content-based load distribution for large scalable services such as WWW servers. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches and introduce one method, connection hand-off, which enables content-based load distribution. We describe a small backwards-compatible extension to the TCP protocol to allow connection hand-off and outline the OS implementation required.
__label__0, Age-related changes of jaws and soft tissue profile are important both for orthodontists and general dentists. Mouth profile is the area which is manipulated during dental treatment. These changes should be planned in accordance with other components of facial profile to achieve ultimate aim of structural balance, functional efficacy, and esthetic harmony. Through this paper, the authors wish to discuss age changes of the hard and soft tissues of human face which would help not only the orthodontists but also oral surgeons, prosthodontists, pedodontists, and general dentists.

__label__0, This Chapter evaluates the consequences of protein modifications in cheeses, with special emphasis on mozzarella cheeses. Basic features of modern and historically relevant cheeses depend on the chemical and physical state of main components. The palatability and consumeristic acceptance strongly depend on the flavour and taste features of the fat phase in foods. On the other side, the modification of proteins is interesting. With specific reference to caseins, the main nitrogen-based structure of the final cheese product, many factors influence protein degradation. Because of the needed bioavailability of free water, the amount of moisture becomes important enough. Unfortunately, higher moisture contents may mean lower shelf-life values and enhanced proteolytic degradation. The aim of this Chapter has been to show analytical results of an emulation study carried out on different industrial high-moisture mozzarella cheeses during storage. Obtained data and calculated results seem to suggest that the amount of small molecules increases globally during time, but demolition is mainly ascribed to medium and large protein molecules.
__label__0, A 38-year-old male, with past history of pulmonary tuberculosis, was referred to us with worsening of dyspnea for 4 days. Dyspnea was initially relieved by bronchodilators, but for the past 2 days, there was no effect of the medications given. He denied any history of trauma, drug abuse, or vigorous exercise. His past history was significant for regular, adequate antituberculosis treatment taken 10 years back. Clinical examination revealed a hyperresonant percussion note, reduced intensity of breath
__label__0, A case of fictitious illness in a young Malaysian Indian male is reported and its relation to the more usual presentation of factitious disorders is discussed. Pathogenesis of this condition and its management are also suggested. Factitious disorders present not uncommonly in this country and it is important for the general duty medical officer and primary care physician to be familiar with this condition.
__label__0, An instrument for measurement of tissue blood flow based on the laser Doppler principle was evaluated using a fluid model. A unique and linear relationship between flowmeter response and flux of red cells was demonstrated with red cell velocities and volume fractions within the normal physiological range of the microcirculatory network of the skin. Different degrees of oxygenation proved to influence the Doppler signal only to a minor extent. The study also shows that the Doppler signal is formed essentially by heterodyne mixing of light beams backscattered in static structures and moving red cells.
__label__0, During the last 20 years we have witnessed an amazing increase in the application of ultrasonic energy in different fields of science. This is especially true for analytical chemistry. The number ofmanuscripts devoted to almost all kinds of analysis dealing with the uses of ultrasonic energy continues to grow year by year. As the uses of ultrasonication have become increasingly important in analytical chemistry so to has the importance of the type of ultrasonic device chosen to work with. Figure 1.1 shows themost commonultrasonic devices usednowadays in analytical applications.Not all devices perform equally and neither are all intended for the same applications. Therefore, thefirst thing to acquirewhendeveloping analytical chemistrywith the aid of ultrasonication is a knowledge of the differences among the ultrasonic apparatus available, especially of the advantages and disadvantages expected for each one. Therefore, this chapter explains the state-of-the-art of ultrasonic technology as applied to analytical chemistry.
__label__0, This paper presents series three-axis micro-force sensors which are based on piezoresistive effect. The structure of these sensors include two critical parts, one central mesa suspended by four single-crystal-silicon sensing beam and one quartz optical fiber probe with ladder structure. By changing the length of the probe, we can get series sensors with different sensitivety and measurement range. The experiment results demonstrate that the linearity of these sensors is very good. These sensors will be used in many fields.
__label__0, Experiments made in vivo and vitro have demonstrated that conservation of allogeneic hemopoietic tissue with glycerin brings about a decrease in transplatation, homologous activity of T lymphocytes. Allogeneic bone marrow conserved with glycerin compares very favourably with freshly prepared allogeneic bone marrow since the transplant-versus-host reaction is attenuated under the effect of glycerin. Moreover, it shows a higher proliferative activity. The glycerin-induced reduction of the inactivating effect of lymphocytes against non-syngeneic colony-forming units enables the conserved bone marrow to be transplanted from several donors.
__label__0, . Sketching activities are widely adopted during early design phases of user interface development to convey informal specifications of the interface presentation and dialog. Designers or even end users can sketch parts or whole of the future interface they want. With the ever increasing availability of different computing platforms, a need arises to continuously support sketching across these platforms having various programming languages, interface development environments and operating systems. To address the needs along these dimensions that pose new challenges to user interface sketching tools, SketchiXML is a multi-platform multi-agent interactive application enabling designers and end users to sketch user interfaces with different levels of details and support for different contexts of use. The results of the sketching are then analyzed to produce interface specifications independently of any context, including user and platform. These specifications are exploited to progressively produce one or many interfaces, for one or many users, platforms, and environments.

__label__0, Knotting Swan-Ganz catheter is a rare complication of hemodynamic monitoring. This is the second case reported in Mexico in over 20 years. Identified risk factors that increase likelihood of loop formation knotting of the catheter are blind introduction and small diameter of catheter, incomplete balloon inflation before advancing it, several tries to wedge it, bending of the catheter by heat, and enlarged right heart chambers. More frequent sites of knotting are right atrium and ventricle, subclavian vein, and pulmonary artery and its branches. Diagnostic confirmation is made by chest radiography, fluoroscopy, and echocardiography. Therapeutic approach depends on knot characteristics, either non-surgical or surgical.
__label__0, Mirrorless graded-index polymer optical fibers doped with the organic dye rhodamine 6G result in very compact broadband fiber lasers in the visible region when pumped from the side. The emission spectrum, threshold, and efficiency obtained on both fiber ends depend on the lengths of the directly illuminated region and of the non-excited ones. The paper analyzes such parameters both experimentally and theoretically for the first time.
__label__0, The recent proliferation of richly structured probabilistic models raises the question of how to automatically determine an appropriate model for a dataset. We investigate this question for a space of matrix decomposition models which can express a variety of widely used models from unsupervised learning. To enable model selection, we organize these models into a context-free grammar which generates a wide variety of structures through the compositional application of a few simple rules. We use our grammar to generically and efficiently infer latent components and estimate predictive likelihood for nearly 2500 structures using a small toolbox of reusable algorithms. Using a greedy search over our grammar, we automatically choose the decomposition structure from raw data by evaluating only a small fraction of all models. The proposed method typically finds the correct structure for synthetic data and backs off gracefully to simpler models under heavy noise. It learns sensible structures for datasets as diverse as image patches, motion capture, 20 Questions, and U.S. Senate votes, all using exactly the same code.
__label__0, Pancreastatin, a 49-amino-acid C-terminal amidated peptide, was isolated from porcine pancreas in 1986. It has been reported to inhibit insulin release and exocrine pancreatic secretion, but both these effects have been disputed. In the isolated perfused rat pancreas we therefore studied the effect of pancreastatin on insulin and exocrine pancreatic secretion. Neither basal exocrine pancreatic secretion, nor exocrine secretion stimulated by CCK-8, bombesin or secretin were affected by pancreastatin. 20 or 200 pM pancreastatin, however, significantly inhibited stimulated insulin release. We conclude that pancreastatin seems to be yet another inhibitory peptide, which--for unknown reasons--inhibits insulin release both in vivo and in vitro, but exocrine pancreatic secretion only in vivo.
__label__0, Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic spore-forming rod. It is a cause of food poisoning, which is frequently associated with the consumption of rice-based dishes. The organism produces an emetic or diarrheal syndrome induced by an emetic toxin and enterotoxin, respectively. Other toxins are produced during growth, including phospholipases, proteases, and hemolysins, one of which, cereolysin, is a thiol-activated hemolysin. These toxins may contribute to the pathogenicity of B. cereus in nongastrointestinal disease. B. cereus isolated from clinical material other than feces or vomitus was commonly dismissed as a contaminant, but increasingly it is being recognized as a species with pathogenic potential. It is now recognized as an infrequent cause of serious nongastrointestinal infection, particularly in drug addicts, the immunosuppressed, neonates, and postsurgical patients, especially when prosthetic implants such as ventricular shunts are inserted. Ocular infections are the commonest types of severe infection, including endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis, and keratitis, usually with the characteristic formation of corneal ring abscesses. Even with prompt surgical and antimicrobial agent treatment, enucleation of the eye and blindness are common sequelae. Septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and surgical and traumatic wound infections are other manifestations of severe disease. B. cereus produces beta-lactamases, unlike Bacillus anthracis, and so is resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics; it is usually susceptible to treatment with clindamycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin. Simultaneous therapy via multiple routes may be required.
__label__0, In transportation networks, traditional fixed sensors are used to monitor the operation of transportation systems. However, fixed sensors cannot move once they are installed. In this paper, the motion ability of traffic sensors is introduced to improve the performance of transportation network surveillance. A mobile traffic sensor routing problem is proposed, modeled as a novel vehicle routing problem. A measure of traffic information acquisition benefits is developed and used to gauge the surveillance performance. To solve this mobile-sensor routing problem, a hybrid two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed, which is based on particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization. Numerical experiments are conducted. The results show that the mobile traffic sensor has a better network surveillance performance than the fixed sensor in most experimental cases.

The main goal is to show how to use generating functions to obtain asymptotic estimates and limit probability laws. The emphasis is on presenting the main ideas while keeping technical details to a minimum.
__label__0, It has been recently hypothesized that anxiety is heterogeneous. Generalized anxiety and panic disorders could be separate entities with specific treatments, as suggested by the fact that some clinical forms of anxiety can be distinguished by characteristic therapeutic responses. The generalized anxiety treatments include benzodiazepines, verbal psychotherapy and relaxation training; they are non mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, at the present time no rational criteria allow to select the best treatment for a particular patient.
__label__0, We validated population-based hospital, emergency room, and physician claim databases for the detection of surgical site infections against the reference standard of clinical surveillance. Although these data sets are highly specific and could be used to define research cohorts, their low sensitivity and positive predictive value make them inadequate for use as quality indicators.
__label__0, In Wireless Sensor Networks life time of the network depends on the energy of the nodes, where energy consumption is mostly used for data transmission rather than sensing and processing. Also, in the WSN, the choice of routing protocol plays an important role in utilizing the energy of nodes efficiently. In this paper, a new novel routing protocol is proposed, which combines the two major categories of hierarchical protocols namely cluster based approach and chain based approach. This proposed algorithm is simulated for weather monitoring application and the results are studied. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing protocols like LEACH, PEGASIS, LEACH-C and CHIRON in the stated application area shows that the proposed algorithm gives better performance in terms of energy utilization, network connectivity and network lifetime.
__label__0, We report a case of dengue fever with features of encephalitis. The diagnosis of dengue was confirmed by the serum antibodies to dengue and the presence of a dengue antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid. This patient had characteristic magnetic resonance imaging brain findings, mainly involving the bilateral thalami, with hemorrhage. Dengue is not primarily a neurotropic virus and encephalopathy is a common finding in Dengue. Hence various other etiological possibilities were considered before concluding this as a case of Dengue encephalitis. This case explains the importance of considering the diagnosis of dengue encephalitis in appropriate situations.
__label__0, Steganography and Watermarking are main parts of the fast developing area of information hiding. Steganography involves hiding of information in a cover media to obtain the stego media, in such a way that the cover media is supposed not to have any embedded image for its unintended recipients. This paper is based on Steganography, Watermarking and Cryptography system where image bits are embedded into higher random LSB layers of audio signals, resulting in increased robustness against noise addition. On the other hand, multi-objective Genetic Algorithm is used to minimize the deviation between original media and embedded media. The basic idea of this paper is to improve security so that probability of detecting the presence of hidden information into cover media is about to zero. For this improvement, image embedding random position numbers are converted to functions and these functions are sent using Symmetric-key encryption algorithm to the receiver end. Key distribution problem is solved by RSA algorithm. We evaluated performance based on imperceptibility, security, robustness, and hiding capacity.
__label__0, This article compares Shakespeare's sonnets with those written by Richard Barnfield in order to examine the possibility of homoerotic subjectivity in early Renaissance England. Social constructionist debates about sexual subjectivity have convincingly argued that "the homosexual"--the person defined by homosexuality--did not exist before the Enlightenment. The sequences of Shakespeare and Barnfield, both of which deal with homoerotic desire, suggest that homoerotic desire could indeed play a role in defining the individuated subject prior to the Enlightenment. However, the ways in which they use homoeroticism also suggest that subjectivity was defined in radically different ways during the period.

It discusses the expression of the power factor for both conventional and static converters driving systems and it also presents a summary of the experiments conducted by authors in recent years.
__label__0, Abstract Three indirect techniques for index flood estimation are analysed in order to evaluate their applicability and effectiveness. These indirect techniques, based on both statistical and conceptual approaches, are applied to a set of 33 hydrometric stations, located in a large area in northern-central Italy. The results show that the statistical model, due to its flexible structure, has a better descriptive ability than the physically-based models, which are rigidly structured as they conceptualize the rainfall-runoff transformation. However, the rigid structure of the conceptual approaches reduces their dependence on the specific information of the single stations and therefore increases their robustness. Finally, the results highlight that direct estimation techniques could be advisable for catchments with peculiar geomorphoclimatic properties; that is to say properties which differ substantively from those of the majority of the basins considered in the identification of the indirect models. This conclusion seems to hold even when a very limited amount of hydrometric information is available.
__label__0, In this study, a hyaluronan-binding complex, which we termed Metastatin, was isolated from bovine cartilage by affinity chromatography and found to have both antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic properties. Metastatin was able to block the formation of tumor nodules in the lungs of mice inoculated with B16BL6 melanoma or Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Single i.v. administration of Metastatin into chicken embryos inhibited the growth of both B16BL6 mouse melanoma and TSU human prostate cancer cells growing on the chorioallantoic membrane. The in vivo biological effect may be attributed to the antiangiogenic activity because Metastatin is able to inhibit the migration and proliferation of cultured endothelial cells as well as vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis on the chorioallantoic membrane. In each case, the effect could be blocked by either heat denaturing the Metastatin or premixing it with hyaluronan, suggesting that its activity critically depends on its ability to bind hyaluronan on the target cells. Collectively, these results suggest that Metastatin is an effective antitumor agent that exhibits antiangiogenic activity.
__label__0, Current cancer treatment regimens do not only target tumor cells, but can also have devastating effects on the spermatogonial stem cell pool, resulting in a lack of functional gametes and hence sterility. In adult men, fertility can be preserved prior to cancer treatment by cryopreservation of ejaculated or surgically retrieved spermatozoa, but this is not an option for prepubertal boys since spermatogenesis does not commence until puberty. Cryopreservation of a testicular biopsy taken before initiation of cancer treatment, followed by in vitro propagation of spermatogonial stem cells and subsequent autotransplantation of these stem cells after cancer treatment, has been suggested as a way to preserve and restore fertility in childhood cancer survivors. This strategy, known as spermatogonial stem cell transplantation, has been successful in mice and other model systems, but has not yet been applied in humans. Although recent progress has brought clinical application of spermatogonial stem cell autotransplantation in closer range, there are still a number of important issues to address. In this paper, we describe the state of the art of spermatogonial stem cell transplantation and outline the hurdles that need to be overcome before clinical implementation.
__label__0, Biological age is a concept that takes into account the heterogeneity of the aging process in different individuals that results in differences in survival and variations in relative health. Any measure of biological age must be better than chronological age at predicting mortality. Several quantitative measures of biological age have been developed. Among them are frailty indices, one of which called FI34 is discussed here in greater detail. FI34 increases exponentially with age reflecting decline in health and function ability. It readily depicts different patterns and trajectories of aging, and it is moderately heritable. Thus, it has been used to identify a genomic region on chromosome 12 associated with healthy aging. FI34 has also been useful in describing the metabolic characteristics of this phenotype, revealing both sex and genetic differences. These differences give rise to specific, testable models regarding healthy aging, which involve cell and tissue damage and mitochondrial metabolism. FI34 has been directly compared to various metrics based on DNA methylation as a predictor of mortality, demonstrating that it outperforms them uniformly. This and other frailty indices take a top-down, systems based view of aging that is cognizant of the integrated function of the complex aging system.
__label__0, A case of sweat gland carcinoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma in a 63-year-old woman is reported. The patient was admitted with the complaint of a lower abdominal pain. Under the diagnosis of a mature cystic teratoma of the right ovary, the tumor was removed. Histologically, adenocarcinoma was found in the wall of the mature cystic teratoma. A part of the tumor showed a differentiation of the secretory portion and duct of the sweat gland. Histochemically, sialic acid containing mucoprotein was defected. Electron microscopically, the tumor cells were found to have secretory granules and intracytoplasmic canaliculi. Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as a sweat gland carcinoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma.
__label__0, It is shown how various ideas that are well established for the solution of Poisson's equation using plane wave and multigrid methods, can be combined with wavelet concepts. The combination of wavelet concepts and multigrid techniques turns out to be particularly fruitful. We propose a modified multigrid V cycle scheme that is not only much simpler, but also more efficient than the standard V cycle. Whereas in the traditional V cycle the residue is passed to the coarser grid levels, this new scheme does not require the calculation of a residue. Instead it works with copies of the charge density on the different grid levels that were obtained from the underlying charge density on the finest grid by wavelet transformations. This scheme is not limited to the pure wavelet setting, where it is faster than the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, but equally well applicable for finite difference discretizations.
__label__0, Water quality management is a very serious problem in the rural areas of developing countries. The main contribution to pollution of water sources in these areas is from diffuse sources, notably from subsistence farming. It is evident that water quality management would only be effective by changing the practices that contribute to diffuse pollution. This paper is based on a project that employed a systematic approach to involve and mobilise rural communities in water quality control programmes. The aim of the project is to develop methodologies that could be employed in rural areas to control the generation of diffuse pollution. The investigation is based on a pilot project in an agro-rural sub-watershed in a developing country. Stakeholder participation and technical control options were concurrently investigated in the development of a community based diffuse pollution management protocol that could be applied in rural areas with poorly developed local government structures.
__label__0, Detection and analysis of trajectories are effective for providing services to pedestrians in public spaces. We have proposed a method to detect moving objects from a monocular image sequence with a normal mixture model. However, the method cannot accommodate a changing number of moving objects. As described herein, to overcome this shortcoming, we proposed two algorithms for counting number of moving objects automatically. They perform successive counting with detection of an increase or decrease of moving objects. We did an experiment using an image sequence from an actual environment to verify the availability of the proposed method.
__label__0, Stroke-prone and -resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with pepstatin or clonidine from 6 weeks of age to 8 weeks of age. Fiborus protein of testes or in vivo incorpotation of 3H-lysine into the protein fractions was determined in each rat strain on the final day. Significant differences were noted between hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, the former rats having greater incorporation rates of 3H-lysine into non-collagenous protein in testicular or mesenteric artery than the normotensive rats. Administration of clonidine decreased the in corporation of 3H-lysine into non-collagenous protein or collagen in the testicular artery concomitantly with the reduction of blood pressure in each rat strain. Pepstatin failed to reduce the incorporation of 3Hlysine into these protein fractions in any vessels examined, and it also failed to alter the blood pressure in hypertensive rats. The amonut of collagen or elastin in testes of hypertensive rats was greater than that of normotensive rats. The data indicate that increased non-collagenous protein and collagen in testicular arteries or mesenteric arteries in SHR or SHRSP can raise the blood pressure in its early hypertensive stage. In addition, increased amount of collagen and elastin in testes of SHRSP apperars tobe derived from hypertensive lesions of testicular arteries.
__label__0, We suggest a continuous-domain stochastic modeling of images that is invariant to spatial resolution. Specifically, we are proposing an estimator that is calibrated with respect to the sampling step, and that can potentially handle aliased data. Motivated by Markov random fields, we assume a continuous-domain ARMA model and suggest an algorithm for estimating the continuous-domain parameters from the sampled data. The continuous-domain parameters we estimate provide features that can further be used for image classification, segmentation and interpolation, regardless of sampling interval values and of aliasing effects that may appear in the digital image. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is preferable over a discrete-domain ARMA modeling.
__label__0, Single-firm event studies play an important role in both scholarship and litigation despite the general invalidity of standard inference. We use a broad cross-section of 2000--2007 CRSP data and find that the standard approach performs poorly in terms of both Type I and Type II error rates. We discuss a simple-to-use alternative, the SQ test, based on sample quantiles of the empirical distribution of pre-event fitted excess returns, which has correct asymptotic Type I error rate. Results suggest that the test will be useful in studying the impact of firm-specific events such as regulation, anti-trust rulings, and corporate or securities litigation.

We develop a combined model for the position of the particles and the dynamics of the piezo-stage and design a linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller to drive the overall estimation error to zero. The scheme is illustrated through simulation.
__label__0, Injections of heparin had no effect on the dextran anaphylactoid reaction in rats but neutralised the inhibitory action both of protamine and of borate. Heparin, protamine, and borate did not modify the histamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine responses in rat paws and so their effects on dextran may be due to modification of the release mechanisms of these two amines from tissue mast cells.

A real-time LCD system for the pure electric vehicle based on the CAN bus is proposed in the paper. The system network hierarchy architecture was analyzed and the system hardware architecture, information exchange protocol and system LCD interface were designed in detail. It realized collection and monitoring for the multi-source information of the vehicle and battery. The actual road tests show that the system is effective, real time, easy installation, and low cost.
__label__0, Pancreatic islet transplantation as a cell-based treatment for diabetes mellitus has been pursued for over quarter of a century, ever since the first successful use of this approach to cure diabetes mellitus in rodents in the 1970s. However, even though autoislet intrahepatic transplantation in patients with chronic pancreatitis who did not have diabetes mellitus was successful in the 1980s, reliable success with alloislet transplantation in patients with diabetes mellitus remained elusive until the year 2000. The reasons for previous failures appear to include use of corticosteroids as an immunosuppressive agent, a drug that both interferes with islet beta-cell function and promotes resistance to insulin action. Corticosteroid-free immunosuppressive regimens in one recent series have permitted much greater success for over 1 year. Benefits accrued in this series include normal fasting glucose levels, normal levels of glycosylated haemoglobin, and total independence from exogenous insulin or other therapy for hyperglycaemia. These dramatic results have presented the research community with the challenges of replicating these results and, ultimately, with providing solutions to the serious supply and demand issues that will inevitably follow.

__label__0, INTRA-ABDOMINAL hemorrhage is the immediate and most urgent indication for splenectomy in cases of traumatic rupture of the spleen. The diagnosis of traumatic rupture of the spleen likewise depends on the presence of the various clinical signs and symptoms produced by intraabdominal hemorrhage, as there are no known laboratory or investigative procedures that can be used directly on the spleen. Hemorrhage following traumatic rupture of the spleen can be divided clinically into the immediate and delayed types, depending on the lapse of time between the accident initiating the trauma and the development of symptoms of internal bleeding. Trauma to the spleen without intra-abdominal hemorrhage occurs more frequently than one would suspect, but as patients with this condition do not come to surgery the number of cases cannot be accurately estimated. Immediate abdominal hemorrhage from the spleen is not infrequently difficult to diagnose early, as patients suffering from this have usually

__label__0, Joseph Lister's painstaking experiments in antiseptic lotions, dressings, and sutures in the 1860s and early 1870s seemed needlessly complex to his critics and were best understood by those who saw him in action. From the 1880s the acrimony subsided, and Lister's international reputation became a major asset to the medical profession, even as it discarded or bypassed many of his techniques. He was claimed as an influence by many new specialties, even though in some cases his links with the discipline were tenuous. By the early twentieth century Lister had become a focus of imperial sentiment, and his legacy is seen at home and abroad through successive generations of students from his Scottish universities.
__label__0, Flexible joint robot manipulators can be decomposed into two cascaded subsystems, a series connection of robot link dynamics and joint dynamics. For these flexible manipulators, we propose the robust controller using a recursive design method. The recursive design procedures are constructive and contain two steps. First, a fictitious robust controller for the robot link dynamics is designed as if the link dynamics had an independent control. As the fictitious control, a nonlinear Hinfin control using the energy dissipation is designed in the sense of L2-gain attenuation from the disturbance caused by uncertainties to performance. Second, a real robust control is designed recursively by using a Lyapunov's second method. The designed robust control is applied to a 2 DOF robot manipulator with joint flexibilities.
__label__0, New nanoparticles based on well-defined dextran esters were prepared by a dialysis process. Dextran was converted into a propionate with a degree of substitution of 1.70 and, subsequently, acylated under homogeneous reaction conditions with a pyroglutamic acid imidazolide, which is prepared in situ by conversion of pyroglutamic acid with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole. The synthesis path allows perfect control of the amphiphilicity and solubility. The highly functionalized polysaccharide derivative avoids the collapse of the nanostructure due to the prevention of hydrogen bond formation. The major fraction of the dextran propionate pyroglutamate nanoparticles investigated by SEM and AFM exhibits narrow size distribution with 370 nm as mean diameter and uniform spherical shape. The SEM image verifies that polymeric nanoparticles in the suspensions did not undergo any morphological changes within 3 weeks.
__label__0, Local anesthetic drugs with prolonged nerve-block effect would have clinical application for postoperative or neuromatous pain relief. This study evaluated the possibility of peripheral nerve neurotoxicity by injection of 10 percent ammonium sulfate. Both intrafascicular and extrafascicular injection of 10 percent ammonium sulfate were tested in the rat sciatic nerve model. One percent lidocaine HCl, 5 percent phenol, and normal saline were similarly injected for comparison. Using histologic studies and motor function evaluation with walking-track analysis, 10 percent ammonium sulfate was found to be neurotoxic when it is injected intrafascicularly; however, extrafascicular injection of this drug did not cause significant nerve injury. The neurotoxicity of the 10 percent ammonium sulfate solution was intermediate between the neurotoxicity of 0.1 percent lidocaine hydrochloride and the marked neurotoxicity of 5 percent phenol solution.
__label__0, The UK National Health Service has a long history of recruiting overseas nurses to meet nursing shortages in the UK. However, recruitment patterns regularly fluctuate in response to political and economic changes. Typically, the UK government gives little consideration of how these unstable recruitment practices affect overseas nurses. In this article, we present findings from two independent research studies from Malawi and Nepal, which aimed to examine how overseas nurses encountered and overcame the challenges linked to recent recruitment and migration restrictions. We show how current UK immigration policy has had a negative impact on overseas nurses' lives. It has led them to explore alternative entry routes into the UK, affecting both the quality of their working lives and their future decisions about whether to stay or return to their home country. We conclude that the shifting forces of nursing workforce demand and supply, leading to abrupt policy changes, have significant implications on overseas nurses' lives, and can leave nurses 'trapped' in the UK. We make recommendations for UK policy-makers to work with key stakeholders in nurse-sending countries to minimize the negative consequences of unstable nurse recruitment, and we highlight the benefits of promoting circular migration.

We show that the elastic mean free path and the dynamics of the scatterers govern the evolution of the autocorrelation of acoustic wave field. A parallel is established between these results and a closely related technique, diffusing acoustic wave spectroscopy. Excellent agreement is found between experiment and theory for a moving stainless steel ball in a water tank, thereby elucidating the underlying physics, and a potential application, fish monitoring inside aquariums, is demonstrated.

__label__0, In this work we have developed an accurate model of total leakage in a transistor stack based on the compact model of gate, subthreshold and band-to-band-tunneling leakage. Using this model, we have analyzed the opportunities for overall stand-by leakage reduction in scaled devices using transistor stacking and proved that the best input vector that minimize overall leakage depends on the relative magnitude of the different leakage components. A novel stacking technique based on the ratio of the different leakage components is proposed and its effectiveness in total leakage reduction in transistor stack and logic gate is analyzed.
__label__0, Many of the modulo arithmetics can be considered as cyclic groups. A generalized method for implementing the cyclic groups is established based on a decomposed mapping approach. In order to obtain efficient implementation of cyclic groups, certain mapping relations and a proper binary encoding method are investigated. Furthermore, a new class of code, called the circulative code, is developed, and two methods for generating such a code are presented. Various modulo arithmetic units can then be easily designed through a unique formula and can also be machine implemented. The modulo arithmetic units using this design approach are usually simpler than those conventional ones.

Early diagnosis rests on recognition of three distinct modes of onset and is important in preventing deformities, blindness, and even death.
__label__0, For nearly thirty years, preference assessments have been utilized in determining items of interest for individuals afflicted with developmental disabilities. Originally, preference assessments were conducted on individuals with severe and profound disabilities, however over time, preference assessments have been adapted to suit individuals with various levels of functioning, as well as those with physical disabilities. Five primary methodologies have become widely accepted for conducting such assessments, and as new techniques have emerged, researchers have conducted a wide range of comparative studies, in hopes of sorting out each respective assessment's strengths and weaknesses, as well as identify which specific populations for which each is best-suited. To this point, the strengths and weaknesses of each assessment have largely been isolated, however the picture is somewhat more cloudy when attempting to match the ideal assessment to a particular subpopulation. Future research may continue to work to clarify this issue, and in addition may utilize new innovations in technology to determine preference in populations previously inaccessible to traditional methods.

It comprises a generic real time crypto coprocessor able to operate over any field, without a specific vendor specific technology. A performance comparison of this synthesized coprocessor is presented for two major FPGA vendors. The results show that the parallelism levels, often applied as a key point for decision-making, do not affect the area and power consumption in a linear manner, instead, present the local optimal points tied to the technology adopted for deployment.

Middleware, and particularly reflective middleware, have been used as a powerful tool to cope with inherent heterogeneous nature of distributed systems and to give them greater adaptability capacities to face their environment. In this paper we propose a distributed reflective middleware for service oriented applications aimed at proposing solutions to cope with fault tolerance problems in the context of services composition and choreography based on the Autonomic Computing Architecture.
__label__0, The paper proposes a simple protocol that ensures sequential consistency. The protocol assumes that the shared memory abstraction is supported by the local memories of nodes that can communicate only by exchanging messages through reliable channels. Unlike other sequential consistency protocols, the one proposed here does not rely on a strong synchronization mechanism, such as an atomic broadcast primitive or a central node managing a copy of every shared object. From a methodological point of view, the protocol is built incrementally starting from the very definition of sequential consistency. It has the noteworthy property that a process that issues a write operation never has to wait for other processes. Depending on the current local state, most read operations issued also have the same property.
__label__0, Visual data mining has been established to effectively analyze large, complex numerical data sets. Especially, the extraction and visualization of inherent structures such as hierarchies and networks has made a signi ffcant leap forward. However, it is still a challenging task for users to explore explicitly given large structures. In this paper, we approach this task by tightly coupling visualization and graph-theoretical methods. Therefore, we investigate if and how visualization can benefft from common graph-theoretical methods - mainly developed for the investigation of social networks - and vice versa. To accomplish this close integration, we introduce a design of a general framework for visual data mining of complex structures. Especially, this design includes an appropriate processing order of different mining and visualization algorithms and their mining results. Furthermore, we discuss some important implementation details of our framework to ensure fast structure processing. Finally, we examine the applicability of the framework for a large real-world data set.

The equilibrium gap method is used to estimate the damage field during a biaxial experiment on a sample made of a composite material. From the analysis of a sequence of measurements, a proposed form of constitutive law is tested and identified. The emphasis is put on the methodology that can be applied to a vast class of materials.
__label__0, Under trait theory, ratings may be modeled as a function of the temperament of the child and the bias of the rater. Two linear structural equation models are described, one for mutual self- and partner ratings, and one for multiple ratings of related individuals. Application of the first model to EASI temperament data collected from spouses rating each other shows moderate agreement between raters and little rating bias. Spouse pairs agree moderately when rating their twin children, but there is significantly rater bias, with greater bias for monozygotic than for dizygotic twins. MLE's of heritability are approximately .5 for all temperament scales with no common environmental variance. Results are discussed with reference to trait validity, the person-situation debate, halo effects, and stereotyping. Questionnaire development using ratings on family members permits increased rater agreement and reduced rater bias.
__label__0, The attainment of the fifth Millennium Development Goal requires adequate national reserves of skilled birth attendants. Nurses, midwives, and their equivalents form the frontline of the formal health system are a critical element of global efforts to reduce ill-health and poverty in the poorest areas of the world. Planning and policies supporting these cadres of workers must be placed high on the development agenda and championed by key international and national players. This article first sets forth an argument for the equity and efficiency of nurses, midwives, and their equivalents as the cadre largely responsible for maternal health. Second, it traces the root causes of neglect of this critical cadre, including a vacuum in political will in the context of poverty, lack of protections for frontline workers, the historical political position of the field of midwifery, lack of a pipeline of secondary school graduates, and gender inequity. Investment in the largely female cadre that cares for the majority of the world's poorer women has simply not been a high enough priority. Five key policy recommendations include harnessing political will and adequate metrics, protection of frontline workers' safety and livelihoods, ensuring an adequate pipeline with a focus on girls' education, donor support for training and professional organizations, and a rapid scale-up of a robust cadre of delivery care professionals. Finally, a call for unified international support of rapid scale-up of cadres of delivery care workers is put forth.
__label__0, This paper describes the use of case laws, dockets as well as other legal publications and attorney profile information to aid the development of a lawyer directory. In order to provide a trustworthy Internet legal research tool, we define a similarity score to represent the match between a lawyer and desired practice experience. The score quantifies the relationship between lawyers and legal experience through litigation records, such as Federal and State cases, as well as profile information, such as published articles in law journals. Relevant documents are linked to different practice areas through an automated classification tool and domain expert mappings. The resulting lawyer-experience mapping enables users to perform an advanced search for lawyers by practice experience in addition to a traditional name search.
__label__0, The polarization analysis of light is typically carried out using modulation schemes. The light of an unknown polarization state is passed through a set of known modulation optics, and a detector is used to measure the total intensity passing the system. The modulation optics is modified several times, and, with the aid of several such measurements, the unknown polarization state of the light can be inferred. How to find the optimal demodulation process has been investigated in the past. However, since the modulation matrix has to be measured for a given instrument and the optical elements can present problems of repeatability, some uncertainty is present in the elements of the modulation matrix or covariances between these elements. We analyze in detail this issue, presenting analytical formulas for calculating the covariance matrix produced by the propagation of such uncertainties on the demodulation matrix, on the inferred Stokes parameters, and on the efficiency of the modulation process. We demonstrate that even if the covariance matrix of the modulation matrix is diagonal, the covariance matrix of the demodulation matrix is in general nondiagonal because matrix inversion is a nonlinear operation. This propagates through the demodulation process and induces correlations on the inferred Stokes parameters.

__label__0, Starting from a general characterization of roles, we focus on the ways in which roles are specified, we examine the formal constraints on their definitions, and propose definitional schemas motivating different kinds of roles. This classification, in addition to clarify the notion of role itself, helps us to reconsider the two standard solutions that have been proposed for the famous counting problem, and to suggest that a third mixed approach may be considered.
__label__0, Many factors have effect on the enhanced recovery after colon surgery. Not only the technical skill but the perioperative events needed to be optimized by the pre- and postoperative issues. Articles were obtained with search for keywords in Medline electronic database and evidences have been ranked according to the recommendation of the Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine Centre. Multicentric, randomised studies have proved that preoperative bowel emptying could not decrease the number of anastomotic insufficiency and wound infection rate; the use of abdominal drains is not necessary in every case; the proper, early oral intake is safe and well tolerated in colo-rectal surgery, and with laparoscopic surgery the same results can be achieved as with open ones. The evidences found even are not used completely. The advantage of laparoscopic surgery can be improved with fast track methods. To use correctly the affecting factors it is essential to know the current literature.
__label__0, It is a commonly held belief that adult stem cells represent the "seeds" for normal cellular replenishment and also for carcinogenesis. The identification and characterization of stem cells for clinical therapeutic applications, however, is extremely challenging for a number of reasons. Recently, our group and others have attempted to isolate stem cells using spheroids from fresh surgical specimens and utilize them for in vitro and in vivo studies. This mini-review summarizes the major technical steps of these methods along with the primary findings. Besides, it critically analyzes the advantages and limitations of the concept and technical approaches. Finally, this mini-review presents our thoughts on the potential future directions of stem cell isolation and cancer stem cell-related research and clinical applications.

__label__0, Wireless sensor network systems depend on many interrelated system parameters. The associated design space is vast, and effective optimization in this space is challenging. In this paper; we introduce a system-level design methodology to find efficient configurations for an application-specific sensor network system where optimization ofenergy consumption is a primary implementation criterion. This methodology incorporatesfine-grained, system-level energy models; analyzes critical parameters of candidate off-the-shelfcomponents; integrates the associatedparameters into a comprehensive optimization framework; and applies optimized configurations to the actual hardware implementation of the targeted sensor network system. The results of fidelity analysis of the models that underlie our optimization framework together with the results of our hardware implementation demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our methodology and supporting tools for optimized configuration of application-specific sensor networks.
__label__0, In this report, we study the complexity of scheduling problems for precedence graphs of bounded width. For such graphs, the size of a maximum anti-chain is bounded by a constant. It is shown that for graphs of bounded width with unit-length tasks and unit communication delays, a minimum-length schedule on m processors can be constructed in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. This approach can be generalised to minimise di erent objective functions. For graphs of width two with arbitrary task lengths, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented that constructs minimum-length and minimum-tardiness schedules on two processors. If its width is at least three, then constructing a minimum-length schedule for a graph with arbitrary task lengths on two processors is shown to be NP-hard. For the case that the width of the graph equals the number of processors, a dynamic-programming algorithm is presented that constructs minimum-length schedules in polynomial time.
__label__0, Alprazolam is the first of the triazolobenzodiazepines to be studied in a large population of depressed patients. In a six-week, double-blind multicenter comparison of alprazolam, imipramine hydrochloride, and placebo in the treatment of 723 patients with depression, the two active drugs were statistically more effective than placebo. Alprazolam was at least as effective as imipramine in relieving depressive symptoms, significantly more effective in relieving somatic symptoms, and showed an earlier onset of activity in some measurements. Anticholinergic side effects were reported most often by patients receiving imipramine, while drowsiness was the only side effect reported most often in the alprazolam group. The Feighner Diagnostic Criteria and prestudy and poststudy intercenter conferences with videotaped patient interviews ensured interrater reliability.
__label__0, In this paper we consider how to organize the sharing of information in a distributed network of sensors and data processors so as to provide explanations for sensor readings with minimal expenditure of energy. We point out that the Minimum Description Length principle provides an approach to information fusion that is more naturally suited to energy minimization than traditional Bayesian approaches. In addition we show that for networks consisting of a large number of identical sensors Kohonen self-organization provides an exact solution to the problem of combing the sensor outputs into minimal description length explanations.
__label__0, Chondromyxoid fibroma occurs primarily in the long tubular bones of the lower extremity, with the foot representing the second most frequent location after the knee. This benign cartilaginous tumor of bone is currently the rarest reported neoplasm of cartilaginous origin. This mass can mimic other benign and malignant bone tumors owing to its variable histologic features. We report 2 cases of chondromyxoid fibroma of the calcaneus with varying presentations. Initially, advanced imaging studies pointed to a diagnosis of a unicameral bone cyst. Pathologic examination is difficult but can be used to differentiate this lesion from more serious conditions. A quick and accurate diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma can prevent unnecessary treatment that could be harmful to the patient.

__label__0, This work was designed to study changes in neonatal behavior during the first two days of life. Infants in Part I were from middle-class backgrounds. Half of these infants had unrestricted maternal contact during the first two days of life, the other half had contact with their mothers only at feeding time. Infants in Part II were from low socioeconomic backgrounds. They were cared for entirely by the nursery staff during the first two days of life, so that differences in maternal style did not affect their behavior. Half of these babies were born to mothers who received 50 mg meperidine during labor, half to mothers who received no meperidine. This work provided evidence for the sensitivity of the neonate during the first two days of life. Both those infants who received unrestricted maternal contact and those whose mothers had received no obstetrical drugs exhibited more behavioral change than those who received low maternal contact or whose mothers had received meperidine during labor. High maternal contact and absence of obstetrical drugs also resulted in increased sensitivity to some environmental stimuli.

This paper calls for the development of methods, techniques and infrastructure to allow the deployment of privacy-aware IT systems, in which humans are integral part of the organizational processes and accountable for their possible misconduct. In particular, we discuss the challenges to be addressed in order to improve organizations privacy practices, as well as the approach to ensure compliance with legal requirements and increasing efficiency.
__label__0, A DSSN model is a neuron model which is designed to be implemented efficiently by digital arithmetic circuit. In our previous study, we expanded this model to support the neuronal activities of several cortical and thalamic neurons; Regular spiking, fast spiking, intrinsically bursting and low-threshold spike. In this paper, we report our implementation of this expanded DSSN model and a kinetic-model-based silicon synapse on an FPGA device. Here, synaptic efficacy was stored in block RAMs, and external connection was realized based on a bus that conform to the address event representation. We simulated our circuit by the Xilinx Vivado design suit.

__label__0, We use a solvable model to examine doubledecay, focusing on the neutrinoless mode. After examining the ways in which the neutrino propagator affects the corresponding matrix element, we address the problem of finite model-space size in shell-model calculations by projecting our exact wave functions onto a smaller subspace. We then test both traditional and more recent prescriptions for constructing effective operators in small model spaces, concluding that the usual treatment of doubleb-decay operators in realistic calculations is unable to fully account for the neglected parts of the model space. We also test the quality of the quasiparticle random phase approximation and examine a recent proposal within that framework to use two-neutrino decay to fix parameters in the Hamiltonian. The procedure eliminates the dependence of neutrinoless decay on some unfixed parameters and reduces the dependence on model-space size, though it does not eliminate the latter completely.
__label__0, Proper authentication is an essential technology for cloud-computing environments in which connections to external environments are common and risks are high. Here, a new scheme is proposed for mutual authentication where the user and cloud server can authenticate one another. The protocol is designed in such a way that it uses steganography as an additional encryption scheme. The scheme achieves authentication using secret sharing. Secret sharing allows a part of the secret to be kept in both sides which when combined becomes the complete secret. The secret contains information about both parties involved. Further, out of band authentication has been used which provides additional security. The proposed protocol provides mutual authentication and session key establishment between the users and the cloud server. Also, the users have been given the flexibility to change the password. Furthermore, strong security features makes the protocol well suited for the cloud environment.

__label__0, The field of software, has, to date, focused almost exclusively on application-independent approaches. In this research, we demonstrate the role of application domain knowledge in the processes used to comprehend computer programs. Our research sought to reconcile two apparently conflicting theories of computer program comprehension by proposing a key role for knowledge of the application domain under examination. We argue that programmers use more top-down comprehension processes when they are familiar with the application domain. When the application domain is unfamiliar, programmers use processes that are more bottom-up in nature. We conducted a protocol analysis study of 24 professional programmers comprehending programs in familiar and unfamiliar application domains. Our findings confirm our thesis.
__label__0, An insurer has requested that you conduct an independent medical evaluation for a 45-year-old woman, focusing on her ability to engage in rehabilitation efforts with the goal of returning to work. Her medical file mentions a predisability history of anxiety, as well as eight years of alcohol and oxycodone abuse. The patient was abstinent from alcohol for six years until one year ago, when she began drinking again. She left work three months later because of anxiety and alcohol abuse. Rehabilitation began six months ago, but her adherence has been limited. Her physician has advised that she is unable to engage in rehabilitation and that setting return-to-work timelines would cause deleterious stress.
__label__0, Throughput maximization of an adaptive transmission system with a finite number of transmission power levels and code rates for communication over slow fading channels is analyzed, based on the concept of information outage. Properties of throughput maximizing policies lead to an iterative algorithm that yields good system designs. Numerical results show that carefully designed discrete adaptive transmission systems with a small number of power levels and code rates can achieve throughput values close to ergodic capacity.
__label__0, A patient with iatrogenic, ultrasound-induced hemi-iris atrophy complained of intraocular lens edge glare and intolerable monocular diplopia. A surgical reconstruction of the iris was undertaken utilizing a new suture manufactured by Ethicon for retention and stabilization of the pupillary lens implant during secondary procedures. A straight general surgical needle 15 mm in length swedged to a 10-0 prolene ophthalmic suture is used to cross the anterior chamber limbus to limbus. The resulting horizontal trans AC suture retains the pupillary lens in position. The McCannel suture technique is modified to produce intracameral iris repair with interrupted 10-0 prolene.
__label__0, This article presents six cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, defined as the combination of acute renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, in six adult patients, two men and four women, between 20 and 52 years old. Three of the cases were considered idiopathic, two secondary to the use of oral contraceptives, and one appeared after an abortion. All of the patients presented severe hypertension, frequently accompanied by increased renin levels; in no cases was there any important coagulation disorder. In all of the biopsies there were lesions denoting intravascular thrombosis in the arterioles and medium-sized arteries of the kidney, as well as thickening of the glomerular basal membrane. Immunofluorescence was positive for fibrinogen and C3 in the majority of biopsies examined. Two patients suffered acute pancreatitis, hypertension having perhaps been an important factor in this complication. One of the two patients died as a result of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis and was the only death in the series. Of the five remaining subjects, three required periodic hemodyalisis and the other two presented a considerable degree of chronic renal failure, which confirms that the prognosis for the hemolytic-uremic syndrome is much worse for the adult than for the child.
__label__0, Abstract Despite having been previously associated with schizophrenia, catatonia is more often associated with mood disorders and factors related to general medical conditions. Benzodiazepines are recommended as the first option in treatment of catatonia. For patients who do not sufficiently respond to benzodiazepines and for patients that need a fast response, electroconvulsive therapy is then recommended. In this case, we present a case that developed catatonia after myocardial infarction and remained catatonic for 1.5 years until he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy.
__label__0, We present a parametric trajectory model for characterizing segmental features and their interaction within the segmental HMMs. The trajectory is obtained by applying the design matrix which includes transitional information on contiguous frames, and it is characterized as a polynomial regression function. To apply the trajectory to the segmental HMM, the extra- and intra-segmental variations are modified to contain the trajectory information. We made some experiments to examine the characteristics of variances and the variabilities in a segment. The experimental results are reported on the TIMIT corpus and performance is shown to improve significantly over that of the conventional HMM.

We take a multifaceted approach to training and supporting the participating teachers. We train them in mathematics content and pedagogy, observe and advise them, and have them engage in self-designed projects to improve their leadership skills. Our data show that this approach has resulted in significant increases in their mathematics content knowledge and increased their rate of retention in their jobs. Professional development, mathematics teacher retention, mathematics content knowledge.
__label__0, A consistent research is being carried out in studying Power System stability as more and more renewable resources are replacing conventional generation. It becomes easier to integrate renewables to the grid because of the advancement in power electronics devices. Such huge amount of penetration can cause severe problems to stability of power system. Hence this paper analyzes the influence of large size solar and wind resource on small signal stability. IEEE 14-Bus system has been chosen as a base case. Eigenvalue analysis is performed on base case and afterwards with the replacement of conventional generation by equivalent size of renewables. It is observed that use of combination of renewables has a better damping than alone. The simulation results confirms and demonstrates the same. The simulation models are developed and analyzed in PSAT software package.
__label__0, This paper addresses a systematic method for the reconstruction and the prediction of a distributed phenomenon characterized by partial differential equations, which is monitored by a sensor network. In the first step, the infinite-dimensional partial differential equation, i.e. distributed-parameter system, is spatially and temporally decomposed leading to a finite-dimensional state space form. In the next step, the state of the resulting lumped-parameter system, which provides an approximation of the solution of the underlying partial differential equations, is dynamically estimated under consideration of uncertainties both occurring in the system and arising from noisy measurements. By using the estimation results, several additional tasks can be achieved by the sensor network, e.g. optimal sensor placement, optimal scheduling, and model improvement. The performance of the proposed model-based reconstruction method is demonstrated by means of simulations.
__label__0, The purpose of this study was to investigate normal physiologic tremor in jaw movement as a factor that may influence chewing performance more directly than either muscle activity or jaw displacement. Chewing performance was defined in terms of the reduction in food particle size after 15 chewing strokes. Data on chewing particle size and electromyographic activity were available for 24 asymptomatic adults from an earlier study. Jaw movements during chewing were recorded using electrognathography, and velocity and acceleration in three planes were determined. Power spectrum for acceleration was calculated during opening and closing phases of the chewing cycle. The frequency of the peak amplitude in the power spectrum represented physiologic tremor of the jaw. Tremor frequencies during both opening and closing phases of the chewing cycle were strong predictors of chewing performance. A multivariate model composed of variables derived from acceleration, together with electromyographic and jaw movement variables, produced a multivariate model that was able to predict chewing performance with an adjusted R2 value of .78.
__label__0, This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation that builds an ensemble of Naive Bayesian classifiers, each of which is based on lexical features that represent co-occurring words in varying sized windows of context. Despite the simplicity of this approach, empirical results disambiguating the widely studied nouns line and interest show that such an ensemble achieves accuracy rivaling the best previously published results.
__label__0, Anti-DNAse B test was performed with microtechnique in 160 subjects including patients with acute streptococcal pharyngitis, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease as well as normal controls. It was shown that the antibody titer varied with age, stage of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease as well as the frequency of benthazine penicillin injections. It was also shown in this study that the school children group had considerably higher geometric mean antibody titer than the adult group. The upper normal limit of anti-DNAse B titer was 240 units in the school children group and 160 units in the adult group. The anti-DNAse B test shows a higher positive detection rate for streptococcal infection than ASO, especially when these two tests are used in combination. In patients with manifestations of acute rheumatic fever without elevation of ASO titer, anti-DNAse B test will be of great diagnostic value.

__label__0, A back propagation artificial neural network was used to extract permafrost information in Huzhong National Nature Reserve, China. 400 field sites of permafrost information were investigated as training sites for the network and accuracy test for the classification results. Different combinations of input sources were used as training layers for the network, which included land cover, equivalent latitude, aspect, and radar image. Results of permafrost classification suggest that the neural network is available in the study area. The best combination to extract permafrost information includes land cover, equivalent latitude and radar image. But aspect may have little use in classifications of permafrost in the area.
__label__0, Neural degeneration is one of the clinical manifestations of ataxia-telangiectasia, a disorder caused by mutations in the Atm protein kinase gene. However, neural degeneration was not detected with general purpose light microscopic methods in previous studies using several different lines of mice with disrupted Atm genes. Here, we show electron microscopic evidence of degeneration of several different types of neurons in the cerebellar cortex of 2-month-old Atm knockout mice, which is accompanied by glial activation, deterioration of neuropil structure, and both pre- and postsynaptic degeneration. These findings are similar to those in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, indicating that Atm knockout mice are a useful model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in this condition and to develop and test strategies to palliate and prevent the disease.
__label__0, Plants possess large arsenals of immune receptors capable of recognizing all pathogen classes. To cause disease, pathogenic organisms must be able to overcome physical barriers, suppress or evade immune perception, and derive nutrients from host tissues. Consequently, to facilitate some of these processes, pathogens secrete effector proteins that promote colonization. This review covers recent advances in the field of effector biology, focusing on conserved cellular processes targeted by effectors from diverse pathogens. The ability of effectors to facilitate pathogen entry into the host interior, suppress plant immune perception, and alter host physiology for pathogen benefit is discussed. Pathogens also deploy effectors in a spatial and temporal manner, depending on infection stage. Recent advances have also enhanced our understanding of effectors acting in specific plant organs and tissues. Effectors are excellent cellular probes that facilitate insight into biological processes as well as key points of vulnerability in plant immune signaling networks.

__label__0, The well-known economic theory predicts that consumer price will fall after a horizontal merger when the amount of marginal cost reduction from operating synergies exceeds the premerger markup of a merging firm. However, when a horizontal merger occurs in a multitier decentralized supply chain where a finite number of firms compete at each tier, we show that this result holds only when a merger occurs at the tier that acts as the leader in the supply chain. In this supply chain, a horizontal merger at any other tier will decrease consumer price when the cost reduction exceeds a certain threshold that is larger than the premerger markup. Moreover, this threshold is increasing as the supply chain gets longer and can be substantially larger than the premerger markup. When accounting for subsequent entry after a merger in long-run equilibrium, contrary to a common belief, a larger synergy from a merger does not necessarily benefit consumers more.    This paper was accepted by Yossiv Aviv, operations management.
__label__0, In this article we introduce, develop, and discuss the theoretical calculations required for the exact solution of a recently reported phase transition, the geodesic to zigzag transition. In this scenario the interfacial transition emerges from geometric competition between a geodesic, shortest path, configuration and a zigzag configuration which is able to reduce its energy by binding to a centrally positioned defect line. From a technical point of view the transition is unusual as it is described by a change from saddle dominated behavior to pole dominated behavior of the integral representing the partition function ratio. We also establish the precise fluctuation behavior of the interface by computing the spin magnetization at any point in the system.
__label__0, We present a carefully designed dependency conversion of the German phrase-structure treebank TiGer that explicitly represents verb ellipses by introducing empty nodes into the tree. Although the conversion process uses heuristics like many other conversion tools we designed them to fail if no reasonable solution can be found. The failing of the conversion process makes it possible to detect elliptical constructions where the head is missing, but it also allows us to find errors in the original annotation. We discuss the conversion process and the heuristics, and describe some design decisions and error corrections that we applied to the corpus. Since most of today's data-driven dependency parsers are not able to handle empty nodes directly during parsing, our conversion tool also derives a canonical dependency format without empty nodes. It is shown experimentally to be well suited for training statistical dependency parsers by comparing the performance of two parsers from different parsing paradigms on the data set of the CoNLL 2009 Shared Task data and our corpus.

However, evaluation methods that have been proposed have not been applied to specific examples. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art in ontology evaluation - current methodologies, criteria and measures, analyse appropriate evaluations that are important to our application - browsing in Wikipedia, and apply these evaluations in the context of ontologies with varied properties. Specifically, we seek to evaluate ontologies based on categories found in Wikipedia.

__label__0, Suppose a two-dimensional dynamical system has a stable attractor that is surrounded by an unstable limit cycle. If the system is additively perturbed by white noise, the rate of escape through the limit cycle will fall off exponentially as the noise strength. The presence of this slowly oscillating factor is due to the nonequilibrium potential of the system being nondifferentiable at the limit cycle. We point out the implications for the weak-noise limit of stochastic resonance models.
__label__0, Cancers are caused by the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations. Particularly, genetic alterations, such as BCR-ABL translocation and EGFR mutation, which are present only in cancer cells, are the best therapeutic targets to date. The application of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, including whole-genome, whole-exome and whole-transcriptome approaches, has brought substantial advances in cancer genomics. These methods will increase the efficiency and resolution of detection of somatic cancer genome alterations, including nucleotide substitutions, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and chromosomal rearrangements. Currently, an international network of cancer genome projects was launched to coordinate large-scale cancer genome studies. The greatest impact of next-generation sequencing of cancer genomes in the near future will be in cancer diagnostics. To provide personalized cancer treatment, development of accurate genetic diagnostic tests and biomarkers is required and will surely be accelerated by next-generation sequencing technology.
__label__0, Species living in a fluctuating medium and human exploitation activities might result in the duration of continuous changes. Such changes can be well-approximated as feedback controls. In this contribution a periodic discrete competitive system subject to feedback controls is proposed. By using the methods of discrete inequality, fixed point theorem, and analysis techniques, a good understanding of the existence and global asymptotic stability of positive periodic solutions is obtained. Some numerical investigations are provided to verify our analytical results.
__label__0, Despite their proven benefits, useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable specifications are not widely available. This is primarily because writing useful, non-trivial specifications from scratch is too hard, time consuming, and requires expertise that is not broadly available. Furthermore, the lack of specifications for widely-used libraries and frameworks, caused by the high cost of writing specifications, tends to have a snowball effect. Core libraries lack specifications, which makes specifying applications that use them expensive. To contain the skyrocketing development and maintenance costs of high assurance systems, this self-perpetuating cycle must be broken. The labor cost of specifying programs can be significantly decreased via advances in specification inference and synthesis, and this has been attempted several times, but with limited success. We believe that practical specification inference and synthesis is an idea whose time has come. Fundamental breakthroughs in this area can be achieved by leveraging the collective intelligence available in software artifacts from millions of open source projects. Fine-grained access to such data sets has been unprecedented, but is now easily available. We identify research directions and report our preliminary results on advances in specification inference that can be had by using such data sets to infer specifications.
__label__0, We review the mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking mediation that occur in sequestered models, where the visible and the hidden sectors are separated by an extra dimension and communicate only via gravitational interactions. By locality, soft breaking terms are forbidden at the classical level and reliably computable within an effective field theory approach at the quantum level. We present a self-contained discussion of these radiative gravitational effects and the resulting pattern of soft masses, and give an overview of realistic model building based on this setup. We consider both flat and warped extra dimensions, as well as the possibility that there be localized kinetic terms for the gravitational fields.
__label__0, Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular process involved in the turnover of most cellular constituents and in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In this study, we show that the activity of autophagy increases in H2O2 or RasV12-induced senescent fibroblasts. Inhibiting autophagy promotes cell apoptosis in senescent cells, suggesting that autophagy activation plays a cytoprotective role. Furthermore, our data indicate that the increase of autophagy in senescent cells is linked to the activation of transcription factor FoxO3A, which blocks ATP generation by transcriptionally up-regulating the expression of PDK4, an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thus leading to AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which FoxO3A factors can activate autophagy via metabolic alteration.
__label__0, In modern computer systems, jobs are divided into short tasks and executed in parallel. Empirical observations in practical systems suggest that the task service times are highly random and the job service time is bottlenecked by the slowest straggling task. One common solution for straggler mitigation is to replicate a task on multiple servers and wait for one replica of the task to finish early. The delay performance of replications depends heavily on the scheduling decisions of when to replicate, which servers to replicate on, and which job to serve first. So far, little is understood on how to optimize these scheduling decisions for minimizing the delay to complete the jobs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on delay-optimal scheduling of replications in both centralized and distributed multi-server systems. Low-complexity scheduling policies are designed and are proven to be delay-optimal or near delay-optimal in stochastic ordering among all causal and non-preemptive policies. These theoretical results are established for general system settings and delay metrics that allow for arbitrary arrival processes, arbitrary job sizes, arbitrary due times, and heterogeneous servers with data locality constraints. Novel sample-path tools are developed to prove these results.
__label__0, Histopathologic changes in the thalamus of 23 rats after somatosensory cortical infarction produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion were examined using the Fink-Heimer silver staining method, immunohistochemistry with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein and laminin, and conventional stains. Middle cerebral artery occlusion produced cortical infarcts in the lateral parietal region, with variable involvement of the frontoparietal parasagittal sensorimotor cortex. Within 3 days after occlusion, massive terminal degeneration but no neuronal changes were apparent in the ipsilateral thalamus. By 1 week after occlusion, abnormal neurons with darkly stained, shrunken nuclei and atrophic perikarya were present in the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei. These neurons were densely argyrophilic in Fink-Heimer sections. Rats with small lateral parietal cortical lesions had degenerating neurons limited to the medial ventroposteromedial nucleus. Large lesions involving the parasagittal sensorimotor cortex resulted in widespread neuronal damage in the ventroposteromedial, ventroposterolateral, intralaminar, and posterior nuclear regions but nowhere else. Immunoreactivity to laminin antibody decreased, and astrocytic proliferation was abundant in affected thalamic areas. These findings are consistent with retrograde neuronal degeneration due to thalamocortical fiber damage in ischemic cortical regions. Such lesions remote from the infarct may influence functional recovery in patients with stroke.
__label__0, Cancer invasion and metastasis have been likened to wound healing gone awry. Despite parallels in cellular behavior between cancer progression and wound healing, the molecular relationships between these two processes and their prognostic implications are unclear. In this study, based on gene expression profiles of fibroblasts from ten anatomic sites, we identify a stereotyped gene expression program in response to serum exposure that appears to reflect the multifaceted role of fibroblasts in wound healing. The genes comprising this fibroblast common serum response are coordinately regulated in many human tumors, allowing us to identify tumors with gene expression signatures suggestive of active wounds. Genes induced in the fibroblast serum-response program are expressed in tumors by the tumor cells themselves, by tumor-associated fibroblasts, or both. The molecular features that define this wound-like phenotype are evident at an early clinical stage, persist during treatment, and predict increased risk of metastasis and death in breast, lung, and gastric carcinomas. Thus, the transcriptional signature of the response of fibroblasts to serum provides a possible link between cancer progression and wound healing, as well as a powerful predictor of the clinical course in several common carcinomas.
__label__0, The interval algorithm by Han and Hoshi is an efficient algorithm which can convert a sequence of random variables into another sequence of random variable with a required probability distribution. In this paper, we extend the interval algorithm to transform a pair of sequences of random variable into another pair of sequences of random variables. The extension allows some independency or functional dependency constraints between the input and output sequences. The possible applications in key extraction and random number generation are discussed. The proposed algorithm can asymptotically achieve the optimal output rate and it minimizes the length of the input sequence required to generate the output sequence for certain input distributions.
__label__0, A 32 year old woman gravida 3 para 2 was admitted in her 33 rd week of pregnancy for management of uterine prolapse in pregnancy. Her first child was age of 3 years and was born by forceps assisted vaginal delivery, weighting 3,8 kg. She had no history of uterine prolapse prior to the current pregnancy. In the 12 th week of gestation, she noticed a protrusion from her vagina. She had no other symptoms. She was able to reduce the protrusion regularly. In the 33 rd week of gestation, she presented with uterine contractions. The os of the prolapsed cervix was closed and elongated. Her contractions were successfully inhibited with calcic inhibitors. At 37 weeks of gestation, a viable male infant weighting 2,6 kg was delivered vaginally following rupture of membranes. She progressed well in labour. The placenta was delivered spontaneously. a vaginal ring pessary was inserted two days later to control the prolapse during the period of involution. After 6 months, she had no longer uterine prolapse.
__label__0, In this paper, we propose a formal framework for specifying rule replacements in nonmonotonic logic programs within the answer-set programming paradigm. Of particular interest are replacement schemas retaining specific notions of equivalence, among them the prominent notions of strong and uniform equivalence, which have been introduced as theoretical tools for program optimization and verification. We derive some general properties of the replacement framework with respect to these notions of equivalence. Moreover, we generalize results about particular replacement schemas which have been established for ground programs to the non-ground case. Finally, we report a number of complexity results which address the problem of deciding how hard it is to apply a replacement to a given program. Our results provide an important step towards the development of effective optimization methods for non-ground answer-set programming, an issue which has not been addressed much so far.
__label__0, UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase catalyzes the conversion of various monosaccharide 1-phosphates to the respective UDP-sugars in the salvage pathway. Using the genomic database, we cloned a putative gene for UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase from Arabidopsis. Although relatively stronger expression was detected in the vascular tissue of leaves and the pollen, AtUSP is expressed in most cell types of Arabidopsis, indicating a housekeeping function in nucleotide sugar metabolism. Recombinant AtUSP expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited broad specificity toward monosaccharide 1-phosphates, resulting in the formation of various UDP-sugars such as UDP-glucose, -galactose, -glucuronic acid, -xylose and -L-arabinose. A loss-of-function mutation in the AtUSP gene caused by T-DNA insertion completely abolished male fertility. These results indicate that AtUSP functions as a UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase in the salvage pathway, and that the generation of UDP-sugars from monosaccharide 1-phosphates catalyzed by AtUSP is essential for pollen development in Arabidopsis.
__label__0, We introduce the two user finite state compound Gaussian interference channel and characterize its capacity region to within one bit. The main contributions involve both novel inner and outer bounds. The inner bound is multilevel superposition coding but the decoding of the levels is opportunistic, depending on the channel state. The genie aided outer bound is motivated by the typical error events of the achievable scheme.
__label__0, The postacute transfer rule was implemented to stop what CMS perceived as double payment for certain DRGs that frequently result in a transfer from a hospital to a postacute care facility. Often, patients are coded as having been discharged to a qualifying postacute care facility when in fact the patient either does not receive the anticipated care or does not receive it within the required regulatory time frame. Hospitals have a right to review all paid acute care inpatient claims for services delivered under transfer DRGs to verify that postacute care was actually provided, and recover payment if the postacute care was not provided within the required time frame.

__label__0, In this study we explore the impact of exposure to social annotation, embedded in online consent forms, on individuals' beliefs and decisions in the context of informed consent. In this controlled between-subjects experiment, participants were presented with an online consent form for a personal genomics study. Individuals were randomly assigned to either a social annotation condition that exposed them to previous users' comments on-screen, or to a traditional consent form without social input. We compared participants' perceptions about their consent decision, their trust in the organization seeking the consent, and their actual consent across conditions. While no significant difference was observed between actual consent rates, we found that on average individuals exposed to social annotation felt that their decision was more informed, and furthermore, that the effect of the exposure to social annotation was stronger among users characterized by relatively lower levels of prior privacy preserving behaviors.
__label__0, The design and performance of polarization-independent isolators that are substantially insensitive to variations of temperature and wavelength are presented. Three single-mode fiber isolators have been designed, constructed, and tested. The first isolator is a 1.3-microm two-stage isolator that has more than 40 dB of isolation and less than 2.0 dB of insertion loss over the temperature range of 15-70 degrees C. The second isolator is a two-stage dual-wavelength isolator with an insertion loss of less than 4 dB and an isolation of better than 35 dB at 1.3 and 1.52 microm over the temperature range of 15-75 degrees C. The third isolator is a three-stage isolator with an insertion loss of less than 2.5 dB and an isolation of better than 63 dB over the wavelength range 1275-1355 nm.
__label__0, As surgeons who care for patients with breast cancer, the possibility of a cancer diagnosis being related to a hereditary predisposition is always a consideration. Not only are we as surgeons always trying to identify these patients and families but also we are often asked about a potential hereditary component by the patients and their family members. It is therefore critical that we accurately assess patients to determine who may benefit from genetic testing. Importantly, the potential benefit for identifying a hereditary breast cancer extends beyond the patient to other family members and the risk may not be only for the development of breast cancers, but for other cancers as well. This review was written from the perspective of a surgeon with additional training in cancer genetics in an effort to provide a unique perspective on the issue and feel that a review of some of the more practical considerations is important.

In this paper, the inverse pseudo-excitation method is used for dealing with such identification problems, and condition number weighted average method is developed to improve the rank defect of the frequency response function matrix during the process of random loading identification; simulation process is given to compare the result between the presented method and routine method. It proves the optimizing result by use of the method; experiments are designed to certify the feasibility of the algorithm, and achieve good results, and the ill-conditioning problem can be conquered to some extent. The condition number of FRF is used to choose the response measuring point, it reduces the workload, and get a accurate result.
__label__0, Low latency interactive data visualizations of large volumes of data are still rare on the web today. Their development requires expertise in server development, API design, dataflow optimization, and browser technologies; developers rarely have the time to optimize the whole stack from server to browser. To lift the burden of client-server co-development, we propose a system that generates visualization applications from declarative visualization and interaction specifications. We envision a system that automatically optimizes a visualization plan to reduce latencies, especially in low-connectivity or mobile networks. In this paper, we investigate the design of automated techniques to determine a partition of work across server and client that minimizes latency. Our cost model is based on a combination of data statistics, network performance, available computing resources, and predicted interactions. As a preliminary evaluation of our approach, we describe how our system could work in the context of two analysis scenarios.

__label__0, In theory, an investor can make infinite profits by taking unlimited positions in an arbitrage. In reality, however, investors must satisfy margin requirements which completely change the economics of arbitrage. We derive the optimal investment policy for a risk-averse investor in a market where there are arbitrage opportunities. We show that it is often optimal to underinvest in the arbitrage by taking a smaller position than margin constraints allow. In some cases, it is actually optimal for an investor to walk away from a pure arbitrage opportunity. Even when the optimal policy is followed, the arbitrage strategy may underperform the riskless asset or have an unimpressive Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, the arbitrage portfolio typically experiences losses at some point before the final convergence date. These results have important implications for the role of arbitrageurs in financial markets.

We report on new algorithms that are more efficient computationally than those presented by Stroud and Saeger and Anand et al. We achieve these efficiencies through a combination of specific numerical methods for finding optimal thresholds for sensor functions and a novel binary decision tree search algorithm that operates on a space of potentially acceptable binary decision trees.
__label__0, The purpose of this study was to better understand if a health educational presentation using culturally adapted materials was understandable and culturally appropriate, and that the content was retained, in an older Vietnamese American population. This study used cognitive interviewing. A convenient sampling was used to recruit eight participants by staff of a community-based organization from its client base. This is the first study to document that family eating style poses a challenge for estimating food intake among Vietnamese Americans. Participants who ate in a family eating style were not able to recall or estimate the number of servings of protein and vegetables. Some older Vietnamese Americans used food for healing and self-adjusted portion sizes from dietary recommendations. Cognitive interviewing is a useful method to improve comprehension, retention, and cultural appropriateness of health educational materials. Further nutrition research concerning intake measurement in ethnic groups that practice a family eating style is warranted.

Also, the subjects' level of experience and perception and satisfaction toward the Nursing Information System had significant correlations.
__label__0, Subject of this paper is an industrial gantry robot with elastic behavior. To suppress residual vibrations command shaping filters are widely used. These filters, however, change the shape and duration of the originally commanded trajectory. Therefore, a command shaping filter is proposed which is based on the inverse model of the flexible robot dynamics. To that end, a planar dynamics model of the robot is derived which is suitable for control design. It captures the relevant dynamics of vibrations including the non-minimum phase characteristics. Based on the inverse dynamics, a feedforward filter for vibration suppression is developed. The tracking error due to filter delay is reduced compared to other command shaping techniques. The non-minimum phase properties of the flexible dynamics are avoided by using a virtual reference point for plant inversion. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed Inverse Model Command Shaper compared to other types of filters tuned for vibration suppression.
__label__0, In order to deal with the problem of fast peg-and-hole alignment with position and attitude uncertainty, this paper presents a visual servoing approach with a single eye-in-hand high-speed camera. The coupling between the position and attitude alignment as well as the dynamics of robot arm exist as challenging issues for the fast convergence of the alignment process. The proposed motion separation strategy innovatively adopts a high-speed 3-DOF active peg to cooperate with the robot arm under high-speed visual feedback. Alignment experiments show that peg-and-hole alignment with the proposed approach could be successfully realized with fast convergence for most cases.

__label__0, Z2 appliance is the pre-adjusted appliance designed for Chinese orthodontic patients. The prescription of the appliance is based on Chinese normal occlusion, which is much different from the West in the first and the second orders as well as the third one. The appliance routinely includes 20 brackets and 8 molar buccal tubers with 3 standard arch forms. Clinically, continued light force is used in whole treatment. The side-effects such as forward tipping of incisors, bite deepening and loss of molar anchorage are reduced further due to fewer tips built into the anterior brackets as well as lower friction elastometric modules used during aligning and leveling. In condition of arch are leveled completely, 0.48 mm x 0.64 mm stainless steel archwire with 1.47 N retraction force is the best combination for sliding mechanics, which is proved by 3D nonlinear finite element study. Self drilling micro-screw is used for maximum anchorage. In finishing stage 0.53 mm x 0.64 mm NT arch wire is added in order to get full torque expressing. The research of Chinese pre-adjusted appliance has been lasted for more than 10 years in the department and clinical studies on Z2 appliance show that with minimal wire bending, treatment is more efficient and result is high quality and more consistent for Chinese orthodontic patients.
__label__0, The fate of chemical and radioactive wastes in the environment is related to the ability of natural phases to attenuate and immobilize contaminants through chemical sorption and precipitation processes. Our understanding of these complex processes at the atomic level is provided by a few experimental and analytical methods such as X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopies. However, due to complexities in the structure and composition of clay and other hydrated minerals, and the inherent uncertainties of the experimental methods, it is important to apply theoretical molecular models for a fundamental atomic-level understanding, interpretation, and prediction of these phenomena. In this effort, we have developed a general force field, CLAYFF, suitable for the simulation of hydrated and multicomponent mineral systems and their interfaces with aqueous solutions. Interatomic potentials were derived from parametrizations incorporating structural and spectroscopic data for a variety of simple hydrated compounds. A...

__label__0, In this paper, we present the system architecture and design flow for remote user physiological data and movement detection using wearable sensor data fusion. Our design utilizes an Android smartphone to integrate and process multiple body sensor data to enhance the reliability for remote health diagnosis. Various sensor data such as body temperature, current geographical location, electrocardiography, body posture and fall detection data are collected using concurrent Bluetooth connections to the Android smartphone. Our Android application software is designed to handle real-time analysis of collected sensor data to determine current user status, such as instant heart beat rate, body orientation and possible fall recognition. With the help of the Internet connection on the Android smartphone, the system communicates with a remote server and a designated contact person to log sensor data, and to notify authorized professionals in case of an emergency situation. Our system is highly valuable for remote and mobile patient monitoring and diagnosis. This design flow can be extended to condition assessments in various environments and it is not limited to body temperature, current geographical location, electrocardiography, body posture and fall detection.
__label__0, Many visible and infrared sampled imaging systems suffer from moderate to severe amounts of aliasing. The problem arises because the large optical apertures required for sufficient light gathering ability result in large spatial cutoff frequencies. In consumer grade cameras, images are often undersampled by a factor of twenty times the suggested Nyquist rate. Most consumer cameras employ birefringent blur filters that purposely blur the image prior to detection to reduce Moire artifacts produced by aliasing. In addition to the obvious Moire artifacts, aliasing introduces other pixel level errors that can cause artificial jagged edges and erroneous intensity values. These types of errors have led some investigators to treat the aliased signal as noise in imaging system design and analysis. The importance of aliasing is dependent on the nature of the imagery and the definition of the assessment task. In this study, we employ a laboratory experiment to characterize the nature of aliasing noise for a variety of object classes. We acquire both raw and blurred imagery to explore the impact of pre-detection antialiasing. We also consider the post detection image restoration requirements to restore the in-band image blur produced by the anti-aliasing schemes.

__label__0, The paper deals with the organization of decision making for multidivision enterprises. If decisions can be represented by linear programming models with divisions sharing resources, an organization is proposed with one division or a combination of these setting resource prices, while the remaining ones determine quantities. The role of each division is determined by the numerical coefficient values as well as the models' structure. This approach is related to, but quite different from, the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle. Interactions between divisions are like ordinary commercial transactions with one party setting the price and the other the quantity traded. The usefulness of this organizational structure depends on its stability for expected variations of model data, which can be determined by parametric variations and simulations. These concepts are applied to a model by R. M. Burton and B. Obel to decide whether the M-form or the U-form organization is preferable. For central values of the model data the M-form turns out to be appropriate, and remains valid for large variations of the coefficients. A comparison with Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition indicates that the proposed approach has significant advantages.
__label__0, Previous research has documented the fragmented nature of software development work. To explain this in more detail, we analyzed software developers' day-to-day information needs. We observed seventeen developers at a large software company and transcribed their activities in go-minute sessions. We analyzed these logs for the information that developers sought, the sources that they used, and the situations th at prevented inform action from being acquired. We identified twenty-one information types and cataloged the outcome and source when each type of information was sought. The most frequently sought information included awareness about artifacts and coworkers. The most often deferred searches included knowledge about design and program behavior, such as why code was written a particular way, what a program was supposed to do, and the cause of a program state. Developers often had to defer tasks because the only source of knowledge was unavailable coworkers.
__label__0, In the rendezvous search problem, two mobile agents must move along the n nodes of a network so as to minimize the time required to meet or rendezvous. When the mobile agents are identical and the network is anonymous, however, the resulting symmetry can make the problem impossible to solve. Symmetry is typically broken by having the mobile agents run either a randomized algorithm or different deterministic algorithms. We investigate the use of identical tokens to break symmetry so that the two mobile agents can run the same deterministic algorithm. After deriving the explicit conditions under which identical tokens can be used to break symmetry on the n node ring, we derive the lower and upper bounds for the time and memory complexity of the rendezvous search problem with various parameter sets. While these results suggest a possible tradeoff between the mobile agents' memory and the time complexity of the rendezvous search problem, we prove that this tradeoff is limited.

One of the most prominent task of Process Mining is the discovery of a control-flow starting from event logs. This paper focuses on the important problem of control-flow discovery starting from a stream of event data. We propose to adapt Heuristics Miner, one of the most effective control-flow discovery algorithms, to the treatment of streams of event data. Two adaptations, based on Lossy Counting and Lossy Counting with Budget, as well as a sliding window based version of Heuristics Miner, are proposed and experimentally compared against both artificial and real streams. Experimental results show the effectiveness of control-flow discovery algorithms for streams on artificial and real datasets.

This approach is based on a multi-criteria hierarchical tree and is built around a decision support system called SADAUDIT. The approach presented in this paper has been applied in a real-life setting in order to audit their procurement logistics information systems. The results obtained are in favor of the robustness of the approach.

This paper aims to study the mutual impacts of these issues and to propose an integrated mathematical framework in order to achieve minimum costs while maintaining frequency-regulation requirements. Inspired by the operational practices and requisites of the real-world microgrid applications, different methods of frequency control are reviewed and discussed. This is followed by developing adequate models for the different types of frequency-regulation mechanisms in the framework of the microgrid generation scheduling problem. The application of the proposed methodology to the Bella Coola microgrid in British Columbia, Canada, is explained, and several numerical results are presented and discussed.
__label__0, This paper addresses an area coverage problem by deploying a network of autonomous mobile sensors. The region to be covered is a bounded and connected two-dimensional region. A decentralized control law is proposed for driving them into a sensor lattice that provides a complete coverage of the region. In particular, this sensor lattice is in the so-called triangular lattice pattern and this coverage pattern is optimal in terms of minimum number of sensors required for the complete coverage of the region. The algorithm is developed based on some simple consensus algorithms. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a numerical simulation has been implemented.
__label__0, This paper describes an architecture framework using heterogeneous hardware accelerators for embedded vision applications. This approach leverages the recent single-chip heterogeneous FPGAs that combine powerful multicore processors with extensive programmable gate array fabric on the same die. We present a framework using an extensive library of pipelined real time vision hardware accelerators and a service-based software architecture. This field-proven system design approach provides embedded vision developers with a powerful software abstraction layer for rapidly and efficiently integrating any of hardware accelerators for applications such as image stabilization, moving target indication, contrast normalization enhancement, and others. The framework allows the service-based software to take advantage of the hardware acceleration blocks available and perform the remainder of the processing in software. As performance requirements increase, more hardware acceleration can be added to the FPGA fabric, thus offloading the main processor.

__label__0, We derive a mathematical model of a part of the blood coagulation cascade set up in a perfusion experiment. Our purpose is to simulate the influence of blood flow and diffusion on the blood coagulation pathway. The resulting model consists of a system of partial differential equations taking into account the spatial distribution of the biochemical species. An important issue is inclusion of a dynamic boundary condition describing adhesion of activated platelets on a collagen coated top lid in the perfusion chamber. The validity of the model is established through criteria on the reaction diffusion and flow equations, which guarantee non negative concentrations at all times. The criteria is applied to the model of the blood coagulation cascade.
__label__0, This paper investigates a hybrid network configuration in which full-duplex base stations serve half-duplex users on both Uplink and Downlink simultaneously. Users are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process while the channel is modeled as a composite fading with correlated Log-normal shadowing and Nakagami-m fading. We characterize the signal-to-interference-ratio at an user of interest, and then evaluate how the network performs in terms of outage probability. We account for the cross-correlation between the user of interest and a random co-site interferer within range. Thus, we provide a valuable insight on on how the hybrid network performs under the assumption of correlated shadowing. We show that when the aforesaid correlation is low, the user of interest can achieve higher data rate at expense of high outage; however, if the distance to the serving base station is short and the cross correlation is high, a satisfactory data rate can be sustained at low outage.

It is shown that such systems are exponentially almost surely stable if and only if their transition matrix is averagely contractive over a finite, yet unknown, time interval. In order to test almost sure stability, an efficient computational procedure based on a Monte Carlo strategy is proposed. The applicability of the proposed method is illustrated by means of a numerical example

__label__0, Is the movement duration time known before we move? To answer this question, a new experimental paradigm is introduced that for the first time monitors the acquisition of a new motor skill in rhesus monkeys. Straight reaches were interleaved with reaches around physical obstacles that elicited a different path geometry. Curved and longer spatial paths were immediately resolved and consistent over months of training. A new temporal strategy separately evolved over repetitions from multiple to a single velocity peak. We propose that the obstacle-avoidance spatial paths were resolved before motion execution and used as reference in the computation of the new dynamics. Path conservation from the first trial occurred both at the hand and at the joint angle levels, whereas the speed profile dramatically changed over time. The spatial solution required no learning and was anticipated by the spontaneous repositioning of the initial arm posture. The learning was in the temporal domain, involving the adjustment of the speed during the motion's first impulse. Within the movement initiation, the partial distance traveled by the hand up to the first velocity peak was finely tuned under a constant time. For a given space location, the time of the first impulse remained robust to learning, but significantly shifted for different targets and obstacle configurations. Differences in the temporal-related parameters across time provided a clear distinction between learning and automatic behavior.
__label__0, Reliable real-time detection of traffic lights is a major concern for the task of autonomous driving. As deep convolutional networks have proven to be a powerful tool in visual object detection, we propose DeepTLR, a camera-based system for real-time detection and classification of traffic lights. Detection and state classification are realized using a single deep convolutional network. DeepTLR does not use any prior knowledge about traffic light locations. Also the detection is executed frame by frame without using temporal information. It is able to detect traffic lights on the whole camera image without any presegmentation. This is achieved by classifying each fine-grained pixel region of the input image and performing a bounding box regression on regions of each class. We show that our algorithm is able to run on frame-rates required for real-time applications while reaching notable results.

__label__0, In order to investigate the role of enteral nutrients in intestinal maturation, an animal model was developed consisting of provision of intravenous nutrient infusions to immature suckling rats over the period of weaning. Age- and litter-matched controls were provided identical amounts of the parenteral solution by entered cannula using the same model. At the end of the period of weaning, animals were killed and the intestines removed for measurement of morphologic parameters and disaccharidase, DNA, and protein levels. The absence of enteral nutrients during weaning resulted in striking inhibition of intestinal growth, diminution in mucosal cell mass, and delayed development of lactase. Although the appearance of sucrase was not affected by the lack of enteral nutrients, sucrase levels rose to only one-third of control levels. Jejunoileal gradients were not present in animals deprived of enteral nutrients but were present in animals receiving enteral nutrients. These results are distinct from adult animals treated in identical experimental fashion and indicate that major parameters of intestinal maturation are altered by the absence of intraluminal nutrients. A critical role for intraluminal nutrients in regulation of intestinal development is therefore suggested. The animal model developed for these studies is well suited for investigation of the interactions of the intraluminal environment with intestinal maturation.

__label__0, Interconnect design has recently become one of the important factors that affect the circuit delay and performance especially in the deep submicron technology. The modelling of interconnects is typically based on using Elmore definitions of the delay time and rise time. So, a general formula for Elmore delay time and rise time in the fractional order domain are presented in this work. It is found from the new formulas of the delay time and rise time that these timing values could be controlled or tuned by the fractional orders. Hence, the fractional order can compensate for the components value. Furthermore, a case study of shunt compensation circuit is studied here to show the impact of the fractional orders on the delay time. The impact of the component values along with the fractional order on the new timing definition is studied using MATLAB analysis.

The approach of collocation approximation is adopted in the derivation of the scheme and then the scheme is applied as simultaneous integrator to special third order initial value problem of ordinary differential equations. This implementation strategy is more accurate and efficient than those given when the same scheme is applied over overlapping intervals in predictor-corrector mode. Furthermore, the new block method possesses the desirable feature of Runge-Kutta method of being self-starting and eliminates the use of predictor- corrector method. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the new scheme over the existing methods.
__label__0, Many machine learning applications are based on data collected from people, such as their tastes and behaviour as well as biological traits and genetic data. Regardless of how important the application might be, one has to make sure individuals' identities or the privacy of the data are not compromised in the analysis. Differential privacy constitutes a powerful framework that prevents breaching of data subject privacy from the output of a computation. Differentially private versions of many important Bayesian inference methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of an efficient unified approach applicable to arbitrary models. In this contribution, we propose a differentially private variational inference method with a very wide applicability. It is built on top of doubly stochastic variational inference, a recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of models. We add differential privacy into doubly stochastic variational inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the method can reach an accuracy close to non-private level under reasonably strong privacy guarantees, clearly improving over previous sampling-based alternatives especially in the strong privacy regime.

An analysis grounded on a simple statistical mechanical theory of hydration allows a plausible rationalization of such enthalpy-entropy noncompensation. It is shown that increasing the strength of solute-water attractive interactions modifying the chemical nature of a part of the solute molecule, but not its size, is a largely noncompensating process for the hydration of noncharged and nonhydrogen bonding species, and dominates the compensating contribution coming from the reorganization of water H bonds.

Results will be influenced by variable factors such as the in vitro age of the blood samples, the degree of hemolysis, the presence of ascorbic acid, and the pH during extraction and elimination of proteins. The radioassay is strongly influenced by the pH of the final reaction mixture, the method used to separate free and protein-bound molecules, and the molecular configuration of the folates present. Based on experimental results presented, I describe a method for the determination of erythrocyte folate.

Different theories and experimental results suggest that either the cerebellar flocculus or the brainstem learns the task and stores the memory. With a dynamical system approach, we clarify the mechanism of transferring the memory generated in the flocculus to the brainstem and that of so-called savings phenomena. The brainstem learning must comply with a sort of Hebbian rule depending on Purkinje-cell activities. In contrast to earlier numerical models, our model is simple but it accommodates explanations and predictions of experimental situations as qualitative features of trajectories in the phase space of synaptic weights, without fine parameter tuning.

__label__0, In this paper, from the adversary's point of view, the optimal strategy to attack a multi-sensor dynamic system is investigated. It is assumed that the system can perfectly detect and remove sensors once they are corrupted by false information injected by an adversary. The adversary is trying to maximize the covariance matrix of the system state estimate by the end of attack period under the constraint that the adversary can only attack the system a few times over time and over sensors, which leads to an integer programming problem. The exhaustive search algorithm has a prohibitive complexity and greedy algorithms are proposed to find the attack strategies. Examples and numerical results are provided in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies.

In their 'on'-state, the stickers bind to ligands in an apposing membrane, whereas they do not interact with the ligands in their 'off'-state. We show that the adhesiveness of the membranes depends sensitively on the rates of the conformational switching process. This dependence is reflected in a resonance at intermediate switching rates, which can lead to large membrane separations and unbinding. Our results may provide insights into novel mechanisms for the controlled adhesion of biological or biomimetic membranes.

__label__0, Data centres are important players in smart cities both as IT service providers and as energy consumers. Integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into the local power grid is one challenge in future smart cities aiming at an IT based low carbon economy. The project DC4Cities takes up this challenge by offering a both technical and business related solution for optimizing the share of local renewable power sources when operating data centres in smart cities. To this end, power management options between the data centre and the smart city together with internal adaptation strategies for data centres are introduced. Finally, an implementation of the suggested approach is presented and evaluated in a simulation.
__label__0, This paper examines programs used in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia to recruit and retain physicians in rural areas. The provinces have many similarities but have unique characteristics that have shaped recruitment methods. The total number of physicians in each province has grown at a faster rate than the population. Each has problems attracting physicians to underserved areas, although the magnitude of the problems vary. The data for this paper were gathered from documents available from various agencies in each province and a series of personal interviews conducted in the spring of 1993. The provinces have chosen different avenues in attempting to solve the maldistribution of physician resources, ranging from regulatory methods in New Brunswick to moves in Newfoundland to encourage graduates of the province's medical school to locate in the rural areas and lessen the dependence on foreign medical graduates. Nova Scotia, with fewer areas needing physicians, has been able to focus its efforts on selected locations. Reviewing the methods used in the three provinces provides an insight into the attempts to solve the shortage of physicians in rural areas.
__label__0, We performed linkage analysis in a pedigree segregating an allele for autosomal dominant, painful myotonia that is potassium sensitive and responsive to acetazolamide. This allele was tightly linked to a skeletal-muscle, sodium channel locus which is now a candidate for the site of the mutational defect in acetazolamide-responsive myotonia congenita. Since this sodium channel locus is completely linked to the disease allele in all hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and paramyotonia congenita pedigrees studied, the molecular alteration causing acetazolamide-responsive myotonia congenita is likely an allelic defect in this human, skeletal-muscle, sodium channel gene.
__label__0, In the paper, a method of two voltmeters for measurement of the frequency characteristic of shunt is described. In this scheme two voltages and phase angle between them on almost equal shunts are measured to determine phase angle between current and voltage of one of shunts. In analysis of errors, it has been found out that this method has practical meaning at phase angle between shunts higher than few degrees, where accuracy is better than 5-10-3 .

__label__0, Analog paper is still often preferred over electronic documents due to specific affordances and rich spatial interaction, in particular if multiple pages are laid out and handled simultaneously. We investigated how interaction with video can benefit from paper-like displays that support interaction with motion and sound. We present a system that includes novel interaction concepts for both video and audio. This includes spatial techniques for temporal navigation, arranging and grouping of videos, virtualizing and materializing contents, as well as focusing on multiple parallel audio sources.
__label__0, Many 1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4-dioxides display the ability to selectively kill the oxygen-poor cells found in solid tumors. As a result, there is a desire for synthetic routes that afford access to substituted 1,2,4-benzotriazine 1-oxides that can be used as direct precursors in the synthesis of 1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4-dioxides. Here we describe the use of Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reactions for the construction of various 1,2,4-benzotriazine 1-oxide analogs bearing substituents at the 3-, 6-, and 7-positions.
__label__0, One growing concern for medical students is our increasing number. The mammoth numbers of medical students accepted into courses in the UK challenge medical school resources. This, in addition to decreasing numbers of in-patient beds and reductions in lengths of stay, makes student access to patients problematic. It is not uncommon for a patient to say you are the fourth student to approach him that day, demonstrating a situation that is both unfair and unreasonable for the patient and one that presents definite challenges to the student.
__label__0, Using gait as a biometric is of increasing interest, yet there are few model-based, parametric, approaches to extract and describe moving articulated objects. One new approach can detect moving parametric objects by evidence gathering, hence accruing known performance advantages in terms of performance and occlusion. Here we show how that the new technique can be extended not only to extract a moving person, but also to extract and concurrently provide a gait signature for use as a biometric. We show the natural relationaship between the bases of these approaches, and the results they can provide. As such, these techniques allow for gait extraction and description for recognition purposes, and with known performance advantages of a well-established vision technique.
__label__0, A new, simple, sensitive method is described for the fluorometric assay of cholinesterase activity based upon the hydrolysis of 1-naphthyl esters and the measurement of the fluorescence of 1-naphthol. This allows the study of the kinetics of cholinesterases and inhibitors with histochemical substrates and permits assessment of the parameters of the enzyme reaction under conditions approximating those in the histochemical system. 1-Naphthylacetate is a substrate for AChE3 and ChE, while 1-naphthyl butyrate is selective for ChE. The application of the procedure to the study of inhibition by hydrolyzable as well as nonhydrolyzable, nonfluorogenic, inhibitors is demonstrated. ACh was found to be a mixed inhibitor of eel AChE in this system. Edrophonium was found to be a more potent competitive inhibitor of AChE than either physostigmine or pyridostigmine, but a much weaker inihibitor of ChE than the latter two. Ambenonium behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of ChE; it is at least 10,000 times more effective on AChE and is 300 times more potent an inhibitor of AChE than is physostigmine. The use of edrophonium and ambenonium as selective inhibitors of AChE is suggested.

__label__0, The management of environmental resources requires long-term data sets concerning different scientific branches and information technologies for different time horizons and spatial scales. Environmental impacts have been caused environmental changes with certain rates of change. Therefore, data collected over long periods have become high importance for environmental analysis, for predictions of environmental changes, and decision making processes for environmental management. Long-term ecological research is designed to capture the interrelationships between ongoing ecosystem developments and environmental changes. Meta-models integrate former experiences and theoretical knowledge about a system with actual information gained by natural processes, man-induced activities, and by political decisions. Because of the great variety and complexity of processes considered for environmental management and their natural or anthropogenic origins different data sets have to be combined. In the paper, some ideas are presented how to combine principles of long-term environmental research and information with short-term environmental decision making.
__label__0, We applied PAC-Bayesian framework to derive generalization bounds for co-clustering. The analysis yielded regularization terms that were absent in the preceding formulations of this task. The bounds suggested that co-clustering should optimize a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information that the cluster variables preserve on row and column indices. Proper regularization enabled us to achieve state-of-the-art results in prediction of the missing ratings in the MovieLens collaborative filtering dataset. In addition a PAC-Bayesian bound for discrete density estimation was derived. We have shown that the PAC-Bayesian bound for classification is a special case of the PAC-Bayesian bound for discrete density estimation. We further introduced combinatorial priors to PAC-Bayesian analysis. The combinatorial priors are more appropriate for discrete domains, as opposed to Gaussian priors, the latter of which are suitable for continuous domains. It was shown that combinatorial priors lead to regularization terms in the form of mutual information.
__label__0, Antithrombin and antiplatelet therapies remain the foundation for the treatment of patients with NSTE ACS. Special groups including women, elderly, diabetics and those with chronic renal insufficiency represent a particular challenge for the clinician evaluating and treating these patients. These individuals are at high risk for ischemic complications including death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned intervention. Typically such patients are under-treated with antithrombins and antiplatelet agents because of an appropriate fear of bleeding complications, resulting in the significant proportion of these patients having ischemic adverse events.
__label__0, In this paper, a new interframe difference algorithm for moving target detection is proposed which is under a static background based on three-frame-difference method in combination with background subtraction method. Firstly, the current frame image subtracts the previous frame and the next frame image separately, their results are added together to get a gray-scale image of the three-frame-difference method. Secondly, the current frame image subtracts the background image to get another gray-scale image of background subtraction method. Thirdly, their sum of the two gray-scale images of above is translated into binary image after being judged by threshold. Finally, this binary image is processed by morphology filtering and connectivity analyzing. Therefore, moving region is obtained. This new algorithm takes advantage of the good performances of three-frame-difference method and background subtraction method adequately. The analysis in theory and experiment results all show that the algorithm is better in efficiency and effect for moving target detection compared to the other similarity method.

__label__0, A B S T R A C T The physicochemical nature of yA was investigated in normal male and female urine concentrated approximately 1000 times. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and Sephadex G-200 chromatography revealed that urinary yA has sedimentation properties intermediate between 19S and 7S molecules. Isolation of urinary yA by DE 52 chromatography free of other immunoglobulins with subsequent antigenic analysis showed that the urinary yA-molecule is antigenically indistinguishable from the yA-molecules found in other external secretions and has a corrected sedimentation coefficient of 11.8S. In addition, like other secretory yA-molecules and unlike serum polymeric yA, urinary yA resisted mild reductive measures with 0.1M f8-mercaptoethanol. Free or unattached secretory "piece" was found in all normal urines tested and in agammaglobulinemic urine. Secretory "piece" antigenic determinants were also found in ureteric urine. The average daily excretion of urinary yA was 1.1 mg. The maximum excretion of urinary 7S -yG per 24 hr was approximately 3 mg.

These defects have persisted. The third attack of dysphasia occurred at the age of 19, and paralleled the previous episode. On this occasion, however, there was no tendency to lapse into German, in either thought or speech, and the duration of the episode was only thirty minutes, ending in complete recovery a t the end of that time.

__label__0, The coincidence of thyroid disorders and breast cancer has long been a subject of debate. Associations with hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis and nontoxic goitre have been reported. Although no convincing evidence exists of a causal role for overt thyroid disease in breast cancer, the preponderance of published work favours an association with hypothyroidism. Geographical variations in the incidence of breast cancer have been attributed to differences in dietary iodine intake and an effect of iodide on the breast has been postulated. Recent reports have shown a direct association between thyroid enlargement, as assessed by ultrasound, and breast cancer. Although the exact mechanism for the demonstrated association between diseases of the thyroid and breast cancer remains to be elucidated, there is at least the possibility that the presence of thyroid abnormalities may influence breast cancer progression and this alone should stimulate awareness into the coincidence of the two disorders.
__label__0, There are many new radar and communications systems that will utilize ultrawide-band antennas. In this investigation, a compact genetic antenna consisting of a set of wires connected in series and with impedance loads is designed and measured. The shape of the antenna and the location of the loads and their impedances are optimized using a genetic algorithm. The resultant antenna is mounted over a ground plane and has elliptical polarization and near hemispherical coverage. It has a VSWR that is under about 4.5 over the 50 to 1 band from 300 to 15000 MHz. The VSWR, radiation patterns and antenna efficiency have been simulated and the VSWR has been measured.
__label__0, We study the global phase diagram of the infinite-range Blume-Emery-Griffiths model both in the canonical and in the microcanonical ensembles. The canonical phase diagram shows first-order and continuous transition lines separated by a tricritical point. We find that below the tricritical point, when the canonical transition is first order, the phase diagrams of the two ensembles disagree. In this region the microcanonical ensemble exhibits energy ranges with negative specific heat and temperature jumps at transition energies. These results can be extended to weakly decaying nonintegrable interactions.

The paper illustrates the benefits of choosing a Numbering strategy that allows for variations in hardware without the need to choose a model number for each variation. The paper goes on to detail the information that will benefit the manufacturer in developing compliance reports that cover a range of configurations. Additionally I provide some tips on building future updates into the framework of the report when appropriate.
__label__0, Most professional communities advocate and employ an assessment of some kind before initiating an action of change. The closer that health promotion programs parallel such models, the easier it will be for their products to be accepted in the health community. This article describes such a comprehensive algorithmic health assessment model, applicable to therapeutic recreation. The focus of the model is on the conceptual interplay between health assessment and the design of prescriptive health promotion plans that are tailored to the individual client. References and general recommendations for applying this model to special populations are provided.
__label__0, Acquired hemophilia is a severe hemorrhagic diathesis characterized by the emergence of anti-factor VIII inhibiting antibodies. It is rarely seen in certain types of cancers as a paraneoplastic syndrome. The case of a 73-year-old patient who developed acquired hemophilia during the course of treatment for a gastrointestinal stromal tumor is presented. A discussion of the diagnosis and treatment of acquired hemophilia as a paraneoplastic syndrome is also included.
__label__0, There is an important mismatch between empirical research on the accuracy of eyewitness identification and the real world of criminal investigation. Most research models single-perpetrator crimes, but in the real world, most crimes involve multiple perpetrators. This study examined how the number of perpetrators affects eyewitness identification by manipulating the gender of accomplices. Observers viewed a video of a staged crime. The crime was committed by a male or female perpetrator, who was presented alone or with an accomplice of the same or the opposite gender. The observers were then asked to identify the perpetrators from target-present or target-absent line-ups. The results revealed a double-perpetrator disadvantage, which was manifested in reduced identification accuracy on target-present line-ups. Importantly, however, the gender of the perpetrator or the accomplice had no effect on this disadvantage. This double-perpetrator disadvantage is attributed to the need to divide attention between two concurrent people, compared to single-culprit crimes, rather than an impairment of visual encoding processes. The implications of these findings are discussed.

__label__0, We motivate and describe an implementation of the MINDS1 speech recognition system. MINDS uses knowledge of dialog structures, user goals and focus in a problem solving situation. The knowledge is combined to form predictions which translate into dynamically generated semantic network grammars. An experiment evaluated recognition accuracy given different levels of knowledge as constraints. Our results show that speech recognition accuracy improves dramatically, when the maximally constrained dynamic network grammar is used to process the speech input signal.
__label__0, The authors report the case of a 35-year old woman with normal heart who voluntarily poisoned herself by swallowing 6 grams of naftidrofuryl. She developed disorders of atrioventricular conduction and a ventricular-like arrhythmia with collapse which resolves after mechanical ventilation. Data from the literature indicate that naftidrofuryl possesses class I electrophysiological properties which must not be ignored and which account for the cardiac effects observed in this particular case and in cases of parenteral overdosage already reported. By analogy with class I antiarrhythmic agents, treatment of naftidrofuryl poisoning with disorders of conduction could include the administration of molar sodium lactate.

In the initial phase of the investigation, 200 mg. was administered daily for 4 weeks to 29 normal subjects at the end of their working day. In the second phase of the study, 7 subjects were given 400 mg. daily for 4 weeks. No evidence of any hepatic dysfunction connected with the use of methylquinazolone was found.

From the early post-war years treating lung cancer with new surgical techniques, through early definitive work in malignant mesothelioma, to today's translational research in cancer biology, the Thoracic Surgery Service continues to be an international leader in educating surgeons in thoracic surgical oncology, conducting clinical trials, and developing innovative therapies to treat thoracic cancers.

__label__0, For several decades, government agencies in the western world have promoted personal responsibility for health and illness. This study explored the extent to which this perspective was integrated into the everyday beliefs about health and illness held by a sample of baby-boomers from eastern Canada. Approximately 150 baby-boomers participated in a series of individual interviews and group discussions. Detailed analysis of their conversation revealed a number of social and personal narratives about the changing character and experience of health and illness. The dominant viewpoint was in terms of lifestyle and personal responsibility. We consider the role of narratives in the construction of social representations of health and illness.
__label__0, Proteomics is loosely defined as the description of sets of proteins from any biological  source, which have in most cases been identified by using mass spectrometry. However,  only the mere identity of proteins present in a certain sample does not give any information  about the dynamics of the proteome, involving relevant cellular events such as protein  synthesis and degradation, or the formation of protein assemblies. In order to retrieve  information on proteome dynamics, relative protein abundances between different protein  samples should be assessed. Comparative or differential proteomics aims to identify and  quantify proteins in different samples, to study e.g. differences between healthy and  diseased states, mutant and wildtype cell lines, undifferentiated and differentiated cells, etc.  Since mass spectrometry is in itself only a qualitative technique, various methods to obtain  quantitative information of the proteome have been developed over the past decade and  will be described in this Chapter.
__label__0, We investigate the concept of symmetry and its role in problem solving. This paper first defines precisely the elements that constitute a "problem" and its "solution," and gives several examples to illustrate these definitions. Given precise definitions of problems, it is relatively straightforward to construct a search process for finding solutions. Finally this paper attempts to exploit the concept of symmetry in improving problem solving.
__label__0, Background The eye is an excellent candidate for gene therapy as it is immune privileged and much of the disease-causing genetics are well understood. Towards this goal, we evaluated the efficiency of compacted DNA nanoparticles as a system for non-viral gene transfer to ocular tissues. The compacted DNA nanoparticles examined here have been shown to be safe and effective in a human clinical trial, have no theoretical limitation on plasmid size, do not provoke immune responses, and can be highly concentrated. Methods and Findings Here we show that these nanoparticles can be targeted to different tissues within the eye by varying the site of injection. Almost all cell types of the eye were capable of transfection by the nanoparticle and produced robust levels of gene expression that were dose-dependent. Most impressively, subretinal delivery of these nanoparticles transfected nearly all of the photoreceptor population and produced expression levels almost equal to that of rod opsin, the highest expressed gene in the retina. Conclusions As no deleterious effects on retinal function were observed, this treatment strategy appears to be clinically viable and provides a highly efficient non-viral technology to safely deliver and express nucleic acids in the retina and other ocular tissues.

Combining a single-tube multiplex PCR with fluorescently labeled primers followed by amplicon analysis using automated fluorescent capillary electrophoresis, each serotype of 92 reference isolates and 297 recently collected clinical isolates was successfully determined.
__label__0, Nanophotonic integrated circuits offer unique advantages for studying the interaction of light fields with mechanical structures. Because nanoscale waveguides are closely size-matched to nanomechanical devices, strong optomechanical interactions arise which can be harnessed in optical systems. The additional mechanical degrees of freedom provided by optomechanical devices are of particular interest for material systems in which tunability of the optical properties is not readily available. Here, suitable materials for the realization of chip-based optomechanical circuits are discussed and analyzed in terms of performance and the achievable quality factors. In particular, materials that offer large electronic band gaps are of interest, because in this case broadband optical transparency is achieved, combined with reduced free carrier effects. Several device geometries that can be used for enhancing optical forces are presented which address both an increase in the field gradient and the net optical force through resonant enhancement. Combining a variety of optomechanical components into full circuits thus provides a new route toward functional nanophotonic circuits with applications in sensing and optical signal processing in a chip-scale framework.
__label__0, PROFESSIONAL FREEDOM Bernard Shaw thought that the N.H.S. would lead to a medical dictatorship, and that in this the freedom of the individual, whether unconventional patient or unorthodox healer, would be threatened. But doctors, by and large, feel much more that it is their own freedom which is in peril. The present close association between State and medical profession is one which is not without its embarrassments to both. It is an uneasy partnership, and until existing tensions are relaxed Medicine will suffer and the public -whom State and Medicine exist to serve-will remain dissatisfied. Whatever an older generation may think about current discontents and dangers, youth seems to be undismayed by all this, if one is to judge by the large numbers clamouring to be admitted to the medical schools. Here, at least, is an old and sound instinct at work, a manifestation of the continuity of Medicine, which will always in the end ride the storm of the contemporary distractions of society and politics. The proper study of mankind is man, and in this modem medicine is at the heart of the matter as never before-how variously is shown in the opening pages of this week's Journal. Yet unless the spirit of medicine remains free and unfettered it may, unless we are vigilant, undergo a sea change, and the mainsprings of its inspiration be damped down. The choice of " professional freedom " as the theme for his Croonian Lectures' by Dr. T. F. Fox, Editor of the Lancet, was therefore timely. In an unstable society he asks us " to consider the usefulness of professions in counteracting social disintegration." He believes that " in a society largely composed of rootless men and women . . . professions, such as law and medicine, are a source of special strength because they have roots going deep into the past and give us a sense of continuity." But the present social context of Medicine is the Welfare State, in which, it may be assumed, the sponsors of it seek to diminish the numbers of the rootless by offering a widespread measure of social security. In sickness or in health, for better or for worse, the Welfare State offers its citizens a cushion of protection against the buffets of Fate. Some measure of protection is essential, but there is a danger that life will become so secure that individual effort will be at a discount and individual irresponsibility at a premium. By seeking to make this what Mr. Churchill-that exemplar of the opposite -called the age of the common man, the extreme
__label__0, We describe a case of maculopathy consisting of macular retinoschisis and serous macular detachment occurring in a patient with an acquired enlarged optic disc cup, similar to the maculopathy observed in congenital optic nerve abnormalities, mainly optic nerve pits and colobomas, without vitreomacular traction nor angiographic leak. Pars plana vitrectomy with argon laser endophotocoagulation and gas tamponade was found to be useful. Traction from membranes covering deep optic disc cups may create small retinal dehiscences, as described in congenital optic nerve abnormalities, which will enable the liquefied vitreous to pass, leading to retinoschisis with or without associated neurosensory detachment. Vitrectomy, photocoagulation, and gas tamponade may be a useful therapy for this entity.
__label__0, Discriminative sensory loss is common following stroke but may not be adequately detected by routine clinical measures. Quantitative tests of texture discrimination and limb position sense have been recently developed. These tests provide reliable estimates of discrimination, differentiate impaired performance following stroke, and have standardized criteria of abnormality. The purpose of this study was to compare predictions of impairment based on current clinical measures with predictions based on these quantitative, standardized measures. Thirty-five patients who had strokes were tested on the new quantitative measures and clinical measures of texture discrimination and limb position sense. The findings indicated poor agreement between impairment defined using current clinical measures and statistically abnormal performance on the new quantitative, norm-referenced measures. The findings suggest that the quantitative tests may provide additional assessment information to supplement that of the existing clinical measures of texture discrimination and limb position sense. Further development of these new quantitative measures is indicated.
__label__0, Robots are complex systems that require multidisciplinary approach to development. Hence, both research and production of a robotic system require a tool that would provide means for coordination between teams with different areas of expertise as well as the ability to integrate, simulate and debug the system in a comprehensive way. Also, with the growing popularity of service robotics, research and modeling of human-machine interaction gains the attention. From a simulation tool, it is expected to support the means for describing this interaction. For that purpose we are investigating the ML DesignerTM, not just as a possible simulation tool, but also as a modeling and design paradigm. For verification purposes we will compare it against MATLAB SimulinkTM. A pneumatic system will be modeled with both tools and a comparison will be performed.

The control loop includes a rectifier and an additional winding connected in series with the working winding of the earpiece, the windings constituting an autotransformer, the additional winding connecting the rectifier to the output of the amplifier stage and the rectifier being connected to the input of the amplifier stage.
__label__0, In the framework of a theory for invariant sensory signal representations, a signature which is invariant and selective for speech sounds can be obtained through projections in template signals and pooling over their transformations under a group. For locally compact groups, e.g., translations, the theory explains the resilience of convolutional neural networks with filter weight sharing and max pooling across their local translations in frequency or time. In this paper we propose a discriminative approach for learning an optimum set of templates, under a family of transformations, namely frequency transpositions and perturbations of the vocal tract length, which are among the primary sources of speech variability. Implicitly, we generalize convolutional networks to transformations other than translations, and derive data-specific templates by training a deep network with convolution-pooling layers and densely connected layers. We demonstrate that such a representation, combining group-generalized convolutions, theoretical invariance guarantees and discriminative template selection, improves frame classification performance over standard translation-CNNs and DNNs on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal datasets.
__label__0, While consequences of unobserved heterogeneity such as biased estimates of binary response regression models are generally known; quantifying these and awareness of situations with more serious impact on inference is however, remarkably lacking. This study examines the effect of unobserved heterogeneity on estimates of the standard logistic model. An estimate of bias was derived for the maximum likelihood estimator , and simulated data was used to investigate a range of situations that influence size of bias due to unobserved heterogeneity. It was found that the position of the probabilities, along the logistic curve, and the variance of the unobserved heterogeneity, were important determinants of size of bias.
__label__0, Two principal objectives of the 1983 Mental Health Act were to decrease the use of emergency orders and to give patients on observation orders the right of appeal. Statistics were collected from the 13 hospitals that admit acute psychiatric patients in the Greater Manchester area, and the figures for 1980-1 were compared with those for 1984-5. Changes in use of the different sections were examined in university units, large psychiatric hospitals, and district general hospital units. The use of emergency orders decreased and the use of treatment orders increased; the use of observation orders remained unchanged. Many more patients exercised their right of appeal in 1984-5, but the number discharged by tribunals remained small. The nurses' holding power was used infrequently. The different types of hospital are now more concordant in their use of these orders than before the 1983 act.
__label__0, Evidence linking psychiatric impairment with divorced marital status and the presence of marital discord is reviewed. Various theoretical models to explain these relationships are considered. Divorced marital status and marital discord are related to psychiatric impairment and mental health service utilization. Available evidence suggests that part of the impairment in these populations is secondary to factors involved in the breakdown of marital relationships and not completely explainable by premarital hypotheses. This has implications for mental health administrators.
__label__0, La convention collective conclue entre le Canadien Pacifique et le Syndicat des employes des transports dans l'Ouest du Canada contient un systeme de remuneration fonde sur un taux de salaire au parcours comportant un kilometrage maximal et minimal. Le present article etudie les donnees economiques de ce systeme de remuneration au parcours de maniere a identifier et a faire comprendre les problemes de negociation collective qu'il engendre. La premiere partie decrit le systeme de remuneration au kilometrage et le replace dans son contexte economique. Bien qu'il soit plus probable que l'employeur veuille limiter les parcours effectues par l'employe a cause de couts de travail a peu pres fixes, le syndicat voudrait, par cette limitation, proteger les emplois ainsi que le temps consacre aux loisirs de ses membres. Pour sa part, l'employeur veut possiblement etablir un kilometrage garanti de facon a reduire toutefois le roulement de la main-d'oeuvre lorsqu'il y a diminution du trafic. C'est pour ce motif que l'on a negocie un parcours maximal de 3 800 milles et un parcours minimal de 2 600 a 3 000 milles par mois. Du cote du syndicat, on a considere le kilometrage maximal comme etant le resultat de la negociation et comme s'il representait pour le membre du rang le choix entre le kilometrage effectue et le temps libre. La deuxieme partie de l'article analyse les motifs economiques de la desaffection croissante du syndicat pour le systeme de remuneration au parcours. Les augmentations de la remuneration au parcours negociees ne sont pas equivalentes parce que les prix a la consommation sont plus eleves et, par consequent, les gains reels plus bas a mesure que l'on se deplace vers l'Ouest a l'interieur de l'unite de negociation. Face a une remuneration plus faible en gains reels, il etait manifeste que les syndiques del'Alberta et de la Colombie Britannique opteraient pour un parcours plus long afin de recuperer ce qu'ils perdaient en gains reels. En consequence, beaucoup de syndiques de ces deux provinces s'opposent aux limitations de parcours, et le Canadien Pacifique peut se montrer sympathique a leur cause, comme moyen de faciliter le recrutement des employes et de reduire le roulement de la main-d'oeuvre. Une des solutions pourrait consister dans l'etablissement de taux differents de salaire selon les regions. L'application de taux differents de salaire semble improbable si les syndiques du Manitoba et de la Saskatchewan ne veulent pas accepter une diminution de leurs gains reels et si le Canadien Pacifique ne veut pas absorber le cout total de taux de remuneration au parcours plus eleve en Alberta et en Colombie Britannique. La derniere partie de l'article traite des resultats probables des negociations sur les restrictions des parcours. De preference a un systeme de remuneration fonde sur des taux differents de salaire, l'abandon des restrictions au kilometrage est ce qui est plus probable dans l'avenir. Cependant, si les ecarts dans les prix a la consommation continuent de croitre, cette solution deviendra moins satisfaisante et l'etablissement de taux de salaire differents selon les regions deviendra plus attrayant.
__label__0, Active learning sequentially selects unlabeled instances to label with the goal of reducing the effort needed to learn a good classifier. Most previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting one unlabeled instance to label at a time while retraining in each iteration. Recently a few batch mode active learning approaches have been proposed that select a set of most informative unlabeled instances in each iteration under the guidance of heuristic scores. In this paper, we propose a discriminative batch mode active learning approach that formulates the instance selection task as a continuous optimization problem over auxiliary instance selection variables. The optimization is formulated to maximize the discriminative classification performance of the target classifier, while also taking the unlabeled data into account. Although the objective is not convex, we can manipulate a quasi-Newton method to obtain a good local solution. Our empirical studies on UCI datasets show that the proposed active learning is more effective than current state-of-the art batch mode active learning algorithms.
__label__0, This paper illustrates a unipolar repetitive nanosecond surface discharge in the subsonic airflows at different velocities. The plasma images presented here indicate that the discharge modes vary with the changes in flow condition. The discharge is promoted in the airflows at a lower velocity. The discharge tends to be either inhibited or even extinguished when the flow velocity accelerates. However, the inhibited mode disappears probably due to the strong memory effect at high repetitive frequency of the pulse.
__label__0, Asthmatics often find difficulties in using an aerosol inhaler correctly as they are unable to co-ordinate the release of a bolus of drug to coincide with an inspiratory effort. This is especially the case with children. The addition of a special attachment to an ordinary inhaler overcame this problem. Twelve asthmatic children produced significantly better PEFR measurements when 0.25 mg terbutaline sulphate was administered via an inhaler with the attachment than when an ordinary inhaler was used alone.

__label__0, Due to the existence of various uncertainties, the design of distributed estimation algorithms with robustness and high accuracy is an urgent demand for sensor network applications. This paper is aimed at investigating the design of distributed parameter estimation algorithms and the analysis of their convergence properties in uncertain sensing and communication environments. Consensus-based distributed parameter estimation algorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time cases are established, which are suitable for unreliable communication networks with stochastic communication noises, random link gains and Markovian signal losses. Under mild conditions on stochastic noises, gain function and topology-switching Markov chain, we establish both the mean square and almost sure convergence of the designed algorithms by use of probability limit theory, algebraic graph theory, stochastic differential equation theory and Markov chain theory. The effect of sensor-dependent gain functions on the convergence of the algorithm is also analyzed.
__label__0, Cooperative activation of the thin filament is known to be influenced by the tight binding of myosin to actin, but the molecular mechanism underlying this contribution of myosin is not well understood. To better understand the structural relationship of myosin with the regulatory troponin complex, resonance energy transfer measurements were used to map the location of troponin relative to a neighboring myosin bound to actin using atomic models. Using a chicken troponin T isoform that contains a single cysteine near the binding interface between troponins T, I, and C, this uniquely labeled cysteine on troponin was found to be remarkably near loop 3 of myosin. This loop has previously been localized near the actin and myosin interface by chemical cross-linking methods, but its functional contributions have not been established. The implications of this close proximity are examined by molecular modeling, which suggests that only restricted conformations of actomyosin can accommodate the presence of troponin at this location near the cross-bridge. This potential for interaction between troponin and myosin heads that bind near it along the thin filament raises the possibility of models in which direct myosin and troponin interactions may play a role in the regulatory mechanism.
__label__0, We study a monomer-dimer model with repulsive interactions between the same species in one dimension. With infinitely strong interactions the model exhibits a continuous transition from a reactive phase to an inactive phase with two equivalent absorbing states. Monte Carlo simulations show that the critical behavior is different from the conventional directed percolation universality class but seems to be consistent with that of the models with the mass conservation of modulo 2.
__label__0, This paper addresses how to leverage the spatial multiplexing function of MIMO links to improve wireless network throughput. Wireless interference modeling of a half-duplex MIMO node is presented, based on which, routing, spatial multiplexing and scheduling are jointly considered in one optimization model. A linear program-based algorithm is proposed for the joint optimization, and numerical simulation results show that the joint optimization of routing with spatial-temporal multiplexing is superior to the separate design approaches, including separating routing from the other two designs, and separating scheduling from the other two designs.
__label__0, Over the last decade, US Super Bol advertising has evolved into a unique phenomenon. US advertisers love the Super Bowl because it has reached an average television audience of over 120 million US viewers for the last 10 years. This manuscript examines the popularity of Super Bowl advertising during the 1990s. Every Super Bowl advertisement aired in the USA during the 10-year period 1990-1999 was video taped and viewed. In addition, USA Today's published Super Bowl advertisement likeability results were incorporated into the analysis. A total of 454 national advertisements were examined with regard to advertisement likeability. The impact of humour, advertisement length, animals, celebrities and product category type on advertisement likeability was assessed with the help of a comprehensive Super Bowl advertisement likeability model. It was hypothesized that each of these variables would be positively related to Super Bowl advertisement likeability. The results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that all these factors except the presence of celebrities had a strong significant impact on advertisement likeability scores.Based on these findings,this paper provides advertising strategy recommendations for future Super Bowl advertisers and marketing academics.
__label__0, For better or for worse, the advent of journal impact factors last century marked a key turning point in the global development of scientific publication and referencing systems. Since that time however, the concept has attracted considerable attention from a variety of sources, and its usefulness for relatively small research fields such as occupational health, has also been debated. For these reasons, the current paper provides a descriptive history of the journal impact factor and a discussion of its relevance for occupational health. Developmental milestones, inherent shortcomings and future challenges are also described, along with techniques used for increasing the impact factor and some potential strategies for improvement of the citation indexing system. While many scholars now question its increasingly prominent role in the evaluation of scientific research, the journal impact factor continues to form an important component in the dissemination and retrieval of scientific literature in the occupational health field, as elsewhere. Due to the controversy incurred since its inception however, and the increasingly diverse manner in which it is now being used, it remains to be seen what the next 50 years of journal impact factors will bring.
__label__0, Acrospiroma, also known as hidradenoma, is a rare cutaneous tumor that has several histological characteristics. As a consequence, a high index of suspicion is necessary for its diagnosis. Here we report a case that illustrates the importance of a good clinical-pathologic correlation in order to recognize this disease.

In particular, it is shown that such launchers can be profitably used for the generation of electromagnetic localized pulses at millimeter waves.
__label__0, We offer a critical review of the current state of opinion role extraction involving opinion verbs. We argue that neither the currently available lexical resources nor the manually annotated text corpora are sufficient to appropriately study this task. We introduce a new corpus focusing on opinion roles of opinion verbs from the Subjectivity Lexicon and show potential benefits of this corpus. We also demonstrate that state-of-the-art classifiers perform rather poorly on this new dataset compared to the standard dataset for the task showing that there still remains significant research to be done.
__label__0, Bronchiolitis is the commonest lower respiratory tract infection in infants needing hospital admission. It is caused by the virus mainly the respiratory syncytial virus. The infants typically present with initial upper respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis, nasal congestion and low grade fever which is followed by tachypnea recessions grunting apnoea and cyanosis in severe cases. Young age group, prematurity congenital heart diseases are the major risk factors for the severe disease. Diagnosis of bronchiolitis is mainly depended on clinical features. Clinical assessment of a child suspected with bronchiolitis should include clinical features to diagnoses the bronchiolitis and to assess the severity of the bronchiolitis. There is no definitive management for bronchiolitis. None of the drugs tried in the management of bronhiolitis have shown their efficacy in reducing the length of hospital stay, severity of the illness or improvement in the outcome. The main stay of management is supportive like minimum handling, supplementary oxygen, and care on fluid and nutrition and ventilator support whenever needed.
__label__0, Government plays a key role in providing higher education. It supplies policies and regulations, information to the society, administers funds and licensing, develops standards, etc. In the context of total e-Governing Ministries of Education of many countries initiated the creation of supporting information systems. These systems in most cases are limited to providing information resources of different kinds to the society by web-portals. Administering and coordinating functions are left out for some reasons. In this paper we discover the typical structure of higher education, different stakeholders involved in the process of providing higher education services, information and data flows. We discuss the key functions that information systems must support. And finally we propose the e-Government higher education reference model to be addressed when developing such information systems.
__label__0, The ability to create views of a network on a fast time scale becomes increasingly important as the complexity and diversity of networks increase. These views, which combine information from many distributed points in the network, can provide an administrator with a better understanding of the interdependencies and interactions between network elements and traffic conditions. Applications that could benefit from being able to compute such "near" real-time views of the network range from performance monitoring to fault management. In this paper, we present the architecture of a distributed management infrastructure that enables such views to be computed. Based on our earlier work on decentralized management, our architecture takes a novel database approach that combines the expressive power of SQL with distributed algorithms. We describe the implementation of the system on platform of embedded Linux devices attached to a network of routers. We provide specific examples of how the system can be used as a powerful distributed real-time monitoring platform. Finally, we derive a performance model of the system and validate it with a set of experiments.
__label__0, Laboratory measurement and acquisition system based on the LabVIEW virtual instrumentation software package, applied to automated procedure for integrated circuit parameter testing, is presented in this paper. Described software controlled procedure is performed on CMOS inverter integrated circuit HCF 4007 UB Hardware configuration of developed solution includes data acquisition card PCI NI 6251 and model of tested integrated circuit, controlled by LabVIEW programming application in PC environment. Multi-channel acquisition card provides generation of test voltage waveforms for inverter circuit inputs and receives voltage signals from integrated circuit outputs. Control software application, developed in LabVIEW 8.0 programming package, performs automated recording and presentation of circuit transfer characteristics, recorded for different supply voltages, including measurement, software analysis and graphic presentation of basic circuit parameters, according to user requirements. This solution eliminates demands for manual measurement of output voltage for each input voltage changing point in circuit transfer characteristic recording procedures, due to providing complete software based automation of these processes. Such approach gives possibility for development of software controlled automated test subsystem or measurement module applicable as a part of more complex ATE systems used in integrated circuit industry production and testing.
__label__0, Machine learning methods are being applied to a wide range of problems in biology and bioinformatics. These methods often rely on configuring high level parameters, or hyperparameters, such as regularization hyperparameters in sparse learning models like graph-guided multitask Lasso methods. Different choices for these hyperparameters will lead to different results, which makes finding good hyperparameter combinations an important task when using these hyperparameter dependent methods. There are several different ways to tune hyperparameters including manual tuning, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. In this paper, we apply three hyperparameter tuning strategies to eQTL analysis including grid and random search in addition to Bayesian optimization. Experiments show that the Bayesian optimization strategy outperforms the other strategies in modeling eQTL associations. Applying this strategy to assess eQTL associations using the 1000 Genomes structural variation genotypes and RNAseq data in gEUVADIS, we identify a set of new SVs associated with gene expression changes in a human population.
__label__0, An orthogonal drawing of a graph is an embedding of the graph in the two-dimensional grid such that edges are routed along grid-lines. In this paper we explore lower bounds for orthogonal graph drawings. We prove lower bounds on the number of bends and, when crossings are not allowed, also lower bounds on the size of the grid.
__label__0, We study ballot secrecy and ballot independence for election schemes. First, we propose a definition of ballot secrecy as an indistinguishability game in the computational model of cryptography. Our definition builds upon and strengthens earlier definitions to ensure that ballot secrecy is preserved in the presence of an adversary that controls the bulletin board and communication channel. Secondly, we propose a definition of ballot independence as an adaptation of a non-malleability definition for asymmetric encryption. We also provide a simpler, equivalent definition as an indistinguishability game. Thirdly, we prove relations between our definitions. In particular, we prove that ballot independence is necessary in election schemes satisfying ballot secrecy. And that ballot independence is sufficient for ballot secrecy in election schemes with zero-knowledge tallying proofs. Fourthly, we demonstrate the applicability of our results by analysing Helios. Our analysis identifies a new attack against Helios, which enables an adversary to determine if a voter did not vote for a candidate chosen by the adversary. The attack requires the adversary to control the bulletin board or communication channel, thus, it could not have been detected by earlier definitions of ballot secrecy. Finally, we prove that ballot secrecy is satisfied by a variant of Helios that uses non-malleable ballots.
__label__0, Recently, major progress has been made to develop computational models to predict and explain the mechanisms and behaviors of gene regulation. Here, we review progress on how these mechanisms and behaviors have been interpreted with analog models, where cell properties continuously modulate transcription, and digital models, where gene modulation involves discrete activation and inactivation events. We introduce recent experimental approaches, which measure these gene regulatory behaviors at single-cell and single-molecule resolution, and we discuss the integration of these approaches with computational models to reveal biophysical insight. By analyzing simple toy models in the context of existing experimental capabilities, we discuss the interplay between different experiments and different models to measure and interpret gene regulatory behaviors. Finally, we review recent successes in the development of predictive computational models for the control of gene regulation behaviors.
__label__0, Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural language processing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering for decades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.
__label__0, 1. The effects of catabolite inactivation upon the trehalose pathway linked to maltose utilization were investigated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutant strains devoid of UDPG-trehalose synthase activity were used in this study. 2. Trehalose accumulation was also susceptible to catabolite inactivation as has been reported for the carrier protein, one of the components of the maltose system. Reversibility was only achieved when incubation with glucose did not exceed 5 min and was dependent upon protein synthesis.
__label__0, The IkappaB kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta are critical in activating the NF-kappaB pathway. Although these proteins have a similar structure that includes kinase, leucine zipper, and helix-loop-helix domains, they exhibit marked differences in their kinase activity and functional properties. For example, IKKbeta has a 10-20-fold higher level of kinase activity for IkappaBalpha than does IKKalpha. Furthermore, disruption of the murine IKKbeta gene, but not the IKKalpha gene, results in severe defects in activating the NF-kappaB pathway. Mice lacking IKKbeta succumb to severe hepatic apoptosis because of failure to activate the NF-kappaB pathway, whereas mice deficient in IKKalpha exhibit skin and skeletal abnormalities and an embryonic lethal phenotype. To better characterize differences in the functional properties of these kinases, hybrid IKK proteins were constructed by domain swapping, and their kinase activity was assayed. These studies demonstrated that differences in the IKKalpha and IKKbeta helix-loop-helix domains are primarily responsible for differences in their kinase activity. In contrast, their kinase and leucine zipper domains exhibited relatively conserved function. These studies further define the properties of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, which are involved in their unique regulatory roles.
__label__0, Leakage monitoring is different from sudden incident monitoring because most of leakage case is a long and slow process. Monitoring sensors are in long erosion and may make mistake decision. We investigate this process and find sensor's neighbors in leakage monitoring can provide useful information. We propose an approach to make use of soft-decision fusion approach to accumulate these useful data. The proposed method optimize soft-function and adjust its range of sensors which provide useful data. The new method reduces noise in sensor network and engrosses in collecting useful data which supports FC to make global decision. In simulation case of Gaussian distributed observations of leakage monitoring, it is proved that the proposed method has a higher performance than the original one.
__label__0, The quality of file system benchmarking has not improved in over a decade of intense research spanning hundreds of publications. Researchers repeatedly use a wide range of poorly designed benchmarks, and in most cases, develop their own ad-hoc benchmarks. Our community lacks a definition of what we want to benchmark in a file system. We propose several dimensions of file system benchmarking and review the wide range of tools and techniques in widespread use. We experimentally show that even the simplest of benchmarks can be fragile, producing performance results spanning orders of magnitude. It is our hope that this paper will spur serious debate in our community, leading to action that can improve how we evaluate our file and storage systems.
__label__0, We present a variant of the stable flow problem. Instead of the traditional flow problem that obeys Kirchhoff's law, for each vertex, the outflow is monotone and piecewise linear to the inflow. In a directed and capacitated network, each vertex has strict preference over their incident edges. A stable flow assignment does not allow a group of vertices to benefit from privately rerouting along a path. In this paper, we first show the existence of flow stability by reducing this variant of stable flow problem to Scarf's Lemma, then introduce a path augmenting algorithm that runs in polynomial time to find such a stable flow.
__label__0, Two hundred and eleven day surgical patients admitted to the day procedures area at Hutt Hospital were surveyed after discharge. The level of patient satisfaction was high, and increased with age. Forty-seven percent of adult patients rated their experience as excellent. Seventy-four percent reported no personal disadvantage of day surgery. The most common advantages were minimal disruption to their lifestyle and that of their family, and avoidance of an overnight stay. Twenty-four percent reported problems after discharge, in particular pain.
__label__0, Predicting the 3D structure of a macromolecule, such as a protein or an RNA molecule, is ranked top among the most difficult and attractive problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. Its importance comes from the relationship between the 3D structure and the function of a given protein or RNA. 3D structures also help to find the ligands of the protein, which are usually small molecules, a key step in drug design. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to accurately obtain the 3D structure of a macromolecule. Many physical measurements of macromolecular 3D structures cannot scale up, due to their large labor costs and the requirements for lab conditions.  In recent years, computational methods have made huge progress due to advance in computation speed and machine learning methods. These methods only need the sequence information to predict 3D structures by employing various mathematical models and machine learning methods. The success of computational methods is highly dependent on a large database of the proteins and RNA with known structures.  However, the performance of computational methods are always expected to be improved. There are several reasons for this. First, we are facing, and will continue to face sparseness of data.Secondly, the 3D structure space is too large for our computational capability.  The two obstacles can be removed by knowledge-based methods, which combine knowledge learned from the known structures and biologists' knowledge of the folding process of protein or RNA. In the dissertation, I will present my results in building a knowledge-based method by using machine learning methods to tackle this problem. My methods include the knowledge constraints on intermediate states, which can highly reduce the solution space of a protein or RNA, in turn increasing the efficiency of the structure folding method and improving its accuracy.
__label__0, There has been considerable efforts to understand the underlying complex dynamics in physiological time series. Methods originated from statistical physics revealed a non-Gaussian statistics and long range correlations in those signals. This suggests that the regulatory system operates out of equilibrium. Herein the complex fluctuations in blood pressure time series were successful described by physiological motivated Langevin equation under a sigmoid restoring force with multiplicative noise.
__label__0, Agarase was used investigate the effect of increasing the number of polymer ends on the electrophoretic trapping of circular DNA in agarose gels. The electric field strength required to trap circular DNA was found to be the same in control and treated gels, indicating the treatment did not result in longer traps. Loading experiments indicated that treated gels had a significantly higher capacity for the open circular DNA. Electrophoretic mobility measurements using pulsed fields indicated a higher density of active traps for treated gels compared to controls. Linear dichroism experiments showed that impalement occurred by a fast and a slow process that had characteristic time constants in the one and tens of seconds ranges, respectively. The open circular DNA was more efficiently impaled in the treated gel compared to the control. The considerably higher efficiency of trapping indicated that agarase treatment increased the concentration of traps substantially.
__label__0, This article presents a generalization of the Boltzmann machine that allows us to use the learning rule for a much wider class of maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori problems, including both supervised and unsupervised learning. Furthermore, the approach allows us to discuss regularization and generalization in the context of Boltzmann machines. We provide an illustrative example concerning parameter estimation in an inhomogeneous Markov field. The regularized adaptation produces a parameter set that closely resembles the "teacher" parameters, hence, will produce segmentations that closely reproduce those of the inhomogeneous teacher network.
__label__0, This study was carried out to evaluate the long-term effect on the donor side of the foot and ankle following vascularized fibular graft resection in children. Eight patients underwent resection of the fibula for the purpose of a vascularized fibular graft by a surgical team who practiced leaving at least 6 cm residual distal fibula. The age of these children at the time of surgery was between 3 and 12 years. They were reviewed between 3 and 12 years after surgery. Two patients who underwent resection of the middle shaft of the fibula at 3 and 5 years of age developed abnormal growth of the distal tibia, leading to ankle valgus. They were treated with growth modulation of the distal tibial physis and supramalleolar osteotomy with tibiofibular synostosis. Another patient who underwent the entire proximal fibula resection at the age of 6 years had developed hindfoot valgus because of weakness of the tibialis posterior muscle. He required talonavicular fusion and flexor hallucis to tibialis posterior muscle transfer. Patients operated at the age of older than 8 years neither had ankle nor hindfoot deformity. We concluded that resection of the middle shaft of the fibula for the purpose of a vascularized fibula graft, leaving a 6 cm distal fibular stump in children younger than 6 years old, may give rise to abnormal growth of the distal tibial physis, leading to valgus ankle. The entire proximal fibular resection for the similar purpose in a 6-year-old child may give rise to weakness of tibialis posterior and hindfoot valgus.
__label__0, We examine how we can define several probability distributions on the set of Boolean functions on a fixed number of variables, starting from a representation of Boolean expressions by trees. Analytic tools give us a systematic way to prove the existence of probability distributions, the main challenge being the actual computation of the distributions. We finally consider the relations between the probability of a Boolean function and its complexity.
__label__0, Recurrent medulloblastoma carries a poor prognosis. Long-term survival has been obtained with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and secondary irradiation. A 21-year-old woman with recurrent medulloblastoma after previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy is presented. The patient was treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. She developed a severe treatment-related encephalopathy which affected her quality of life and neurocognitive functioning for the rest of her life. Possible causative factors are discussed and central nervous system toxicity by high-dose chemotherapy in brain tumour patients is reviewed. Case reports on severe central nervous system toxicity have been reported, but data from prospective studies on neurocognitive functioning are not available. These data strongly support a systematic long-term follow-up of brain tumour patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy with emphasis on neurocognitive function tests.
__label__0, Fluoroquinolones have been used worldwide against a variety of infections because of their potent antibacterial activity and good pharmacokinetics. In Europe and USA, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin showed a good therapeutic efficacy for the past decade by sequential therapy for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive pathogens including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Recently, injection form of ciprofloxacin was launched in Japan, and pazufloxacin, gatifloxacin, and sitafloxacin are under development. Appropriate usage of these injectable quinolones in Japanese medical practice should be established from the potency of each drug, the surveillance data of drug-resistance, and the experience in Europe and USA.
__label__0, Currently used antifungal drugs are distinct in terms of spectrum of activity, potency, therapeutic index, development of resistance, and mode of use. An important factor in the usefulnesss of a compound is the mechanism by which it attacks the structure and function of the fungal cell. The target organelles have been established for most antifungal drugs. Polyenes bind irreversibly to cell membranes. Alteration of the permeability of these structures precedes metabolic disruption and cell death. Griseofulvin deteriorates spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules, influencing cell division and outgrowth of hyphal tips. Flucytosine is deaminated to 5-fluorouracil, which is then phosphorylated and incorporated into RNA; protein synthesis is consequently impaired. A mechanism of action via inhibition of DNA synthesis is an alternative explanation. The imidazole derivatives inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the main sterol in membranes of fungi. These agents also affect the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids. Changes in oxidative and peroxidative enzyme activities, leading to an intracellular buildup of toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, may contribute to the observed deterioration of subcellular organelles and to cell necrosis. The imidazole derivatives inhibit the transformation of blastospores of Candida albicans into the invasive mycelial form. This inhibition probably facilitates the task of host defense cells and may be the principal factor leading to clearance of infection.
__label__0, A vital aspect of device and implant regulation is continual surveillance of performance after approval. Most permanent implants seldom reveal their strengths and weaknesses until they have been in clinical use for a number of years. It is vital that clinicians report problems to the manufacturers and regulatory authorities to enable emerging hazards to be promptly identified.
__label__0, Although single-incision laparoscopic surgery made an appearance on the surgical scene only recently, it is being increasingly applied in the treatment of a variety of disorders. We report single-incision bilateral laparoscopic oophorectomy and salpingooophorectomy performed in two patients who had previously undergone breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer. Each procedure was undertaken using two 5-mm and one 3-mm ports inserted through a 2-cm transverse supraumbilical incision and standard laparoscopic instruments. The operative time was 50 and 65 min respectively and the blood loss negligible. The patients were discharged 36 and 24 h after surgery, required minimal postoperative analgesia and remain well at a follow up of 19 and 17 months, respectively. With the benefit of improved cosmesis, the single-incision approach holds the potential to replace the traditional bilateral laparoscopic oophorectomy.
__label__0, Congenital anomaly of the oval window with an abnormal facial nerve course is an uncommon embryological defect, which is related to the underdevelopment of second branchial arch derivatives. Some treatments for improving hearing levels are available; these include hearing aids, vestibulotomy, neo-oval window formation, and stapes surgeries, including incudostapedotomy and malleostapedotomy. However, surgery for congenital anomalies of the oval window has rarely been described, usually in very small series of patients. We describe two cases of congenital anomalies of the oval window with aberrant facial nerve courses. One was a 40-year-old male diagnosed with unilateral congenital oval window atresia; the other was a 10-year-old male diagnosed with bilateral congenital oval window atresia. We also describe the clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes of malleostapedotomy for congenital anomalies of the oval window with aberrant facial nerve courses.
__label__0, We investigate basic issues of motion planning for a class of dynamic mobile robots, focusing on eel-like swimming robots. A primary characteristic of this class of robots is that drift plays a significant role in the generation of motion. We provide a brief summary of our previous work in eel-like robotics, in which we explored generic gait patterns that could be used to drive an eel-like robot. We make an analogy with kinematic car-like robots to develop feedback algorithms to perform trajectory trucking about a nominal path. We use these control laws in closed-loop experiments with an underwater eel-like robot, using a vision based position sensing system to provide feedback.
__label__0, In speech recognition, a discriminative frequency weighting can be achieved by decorrelating the frequency sequence of log mel-scaled filter-bank energies with a computationally inexpensive filter. We show how the spectral parameters that result from this kind of frequency filtering, both alone and combined with filtering of their time trajectories, are competitive with respect to the conventional cepstral representations of speech signals.
__label__0, Sterility and utility are essential in surgical draping. For craniotomy, we modified the course of the irrigation hose to maintain a free foot space for the surgeon by connection with a suction bottle placed beside the patient's body through a slit made in the linen. This minor modification provides convenience to the surgeon during operations.
__label__0, Forecasting currency exchange rates are an important financial problem that is receiving increasing attention especially because of its intrinsic difficulty and practical applications. This paper presents improved neural network and fuzzy models used for exchange rate prediction. Several approaches including multi-layer perceprtons, radial basis functions, dynamic neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems have been proposed and discussed. Their performances for one-step a-head predictions have been evaluated through a study, using real exchange daily rate values of the US Dollar vs. British Pound.
__label__0, Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic blood disorders in the United States that affects 1 in every 375 African Americans. Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition caused by abnormal hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The Human Genome Project has provided valuable insight and extensive research advances in the understanding of the human genome and sickle cell disease. Significant progress in genetic knowledge has led to an increase in the ability for researchers to map and sequence genes for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of sickle cell disease and other chronic illnesses. This article explores some of the recent knowledge and advances about sickle cell disease and the Human Genome Project.

__label__0, Urban climate modeling is a means to increase the understanding of the urban climate. In order to model real world environments, area-wide spatial information is required. This paper demonstrates how hyperspectral remote sensing data and additional height data can provide a large part of this information efficiently, reducing the need for extensive field surveys. From the hyperspectral data the surface materials, the LAI and the surface albedo are estimated. The height data supplies the heights of buildings and trees. Using these maps as input for the urban micro climate model ENVI-met, simulations of temperature, wind and humidity among others can be carried out.
__label__0, If social learning is more efficient than independent individual exploration, animals should learn vital cultural skills exclusively, and routine skills faster, through social learning, provided they actually use social learning preferentially. Animals with opportunities for social learning indeed do so. Moreover, more frequent opportunities for social learning should boost an individual's repertoire of learned skills. This prediction is confirmed by comparisons among wild great ape populations and by social deprivation and enculturation experiments. These findings shaped the cultural intelligence hypothesis, which complements the traditional benefit hypotheses for the evolution of intelligence by specifying the conditions in which these benefits can be reaped. The evolutionary version of the hypothesis argues that species with frequent opportunities for social learning should more readily respond to selection for a greater number of learned skills. Because improved social learning also improves asocial learning, the hypothesis predicts a positive interspecific correlation between social-learning performance and individual learning ability. Variation among primates supports this prediction. The hypothesis also predicts that more heavily cultural species should be more intelligent. Preliminary tests involving birds and mammals support this prediction too. The cultural intelligence hypothesis can also account for the unusual cognitive abilities of humans, as well as our unique mechanisms of skill transfer.
__label__0, We present a wavelet image coder based on an explicit model of the conditional statistical relationships between coefficients in different subbands. In particular, we construct a parameterized model for the conditional probability of a coefficient given coefficients at a coarser scale. Subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a non-adaptive arithmetic encoder. The overall ordering of bitplanes is determined by the ratio of their encoded variance to compressed size. We show rate-distortion comparisons of the coder to first and second-order theoretical entropy bounds and the EZW coder. The coder is inherently embedded, and should prove useful in applications requiring progressive transmission.

A special form of demodulation is described and compared with conventional discriminators. Under several conditions, significant improvements in demodulation quality are obtained.
__label__0, Model-Driven Development approach became popular in past years. Domain-specific profiles are defined for various domains and tools are used to transform models using these profiles to source code artifacts. However, rules need to be defined for the profile elements usage so the transformation can be eective and reliable. This paper deals with an approach of expressing these rules using spe- cial type of metamodel with UML class diagrams with the stereotypes defined in the profile - we call them constraint diagrams. Each class in this metamodel represent all classes in the model with the same stereo- type. Using stereotyped associations, we can link classes with dierent stereotypes and restrict the usage of such stereotype only to relations between specific stereotyped classes in the model. OCL constraints can be generated from the constraint diagram to enable validation of the model according to the rules in the metamodel. This paper deals with the description of the constraint diagram creation and OCL constraints generation.
__label__0, We investigate the use of gossip protocols to detect threshold crossings of network-wide aggregates. Aggregates are computed from local device variables using functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX and MIN. The process of aggregation and detection is performed using a standard gossiping scheme. A key design element is to let nodes dynamically adjust their neighbor interaction rates according to the distance between the nodes' local estimate of the global aggregate and the threshold itself. We show that this allows considerable savings in communication overhead. In particular, the overhead becomes negligible when the aggregate is sufficiently far above or far below the threshold. We present evaluation results from simulation studies regarding protocol efficiency, quality of threshold detection, scalability, and controllability.

These antennas have an omni-directional impulse response in azimuth and pulse duration of 0.5-0.65 nanoseconds. In addition, the measured data show a reasonable peak received signal in a pulse communication link using two identical antennas.
__label__0, Assessing student understanding by evaluating their free text answers to posed questions is a very important task. However, manually, it is time-consuming and computationally, it is difficult. This paper details our shallow NLP approach to computationally assessing student free text answers when a reference answer is provided. For four out of the five test sets, our system achieved an overall accuracy above the median and mean.
__label__0, We present numerical simulations of the capacitive coupling between graphene nanoribbons of various widths and gate electrodes in different configurations. We compare the influence of lateral metallic or graphene side gate structures on the overall back gate capacitive coupling. Most interestingly, we find a complex interplay between quantum capacitance effects in the graphene nanoribbon and the lateral graphene side gates, giving rise to an unconventional negative quantum capacitance. The emerging non-linear capacitive couplings are investigated in detail. The experimentally relevant relative lever arm, the ratio between the coupling of the different gate structures, is discussed.

__label__0, We study tight bounds and fast algorithms for LCLMs of several linear differential operators with polynomial coefficients. We analyse the arithmetic complexity of existing algorithms for LCLMs, as well as the size of their outputs. We propose a new algorithm that recasts the LCLM computation in a linear algebra problem on a polynomial matrix. This algorithm yields sharp bounds on the coefficient degrees of the LCLM, improving by one order of magnitude the best bounds obtained using previous algorithms. The complexity of the new algorithm is almost optimal, in the sense that it nearly matches the arithmetic size of the output.

Direct smear of tracheal aspirate stained with Gram revealed gram-positive branched filamentous hyphae and numerous leukocytes. Pure culture of colonies of a chalky white apperance grew on the blood agar after prolonged incubation. The microorganism was identified as Nocardia asteroides by standard methods.
__label__0, In order to build reliable and robust structures for the future power supply, flexibilities of electrical generation, consumption and storage have to be increased. Within Dual Demand Side Management, the feasibility of a city quarter to manage locally its energy supply and to stabilize the regional grid is investigated. The concept focuses on the potential thermal storage systems provided by the existing building stock and on heat pumps as well as combined heat and power systems as generation and flexible storage units. Further, the physical building model and the distribution grid model will be coupled to a multi-energy simulation platform, to investigate the energy management options and the load shifting potential. In this paper we present the challenges met in process of system modeling. The chosen approaches are presented in two main sections, modeling and simulation requirements, together with discussed alternative solutions, drawbacks and limitations. The section Modeling deals with the user model and electricity demand forecasting, the building and electrical models. Main issues in the development of the building model concern the lack of available information of residents' behavior and building characteristics for its parameterization. Computational issues regarding the multi-energy simulation platform are discussed separately for the model coupling, the electrical and thermal simulation in the section Simulation Requirements.

Both the direct and indirect effect of lightning shall disserve seriously to the highly information-based ship system. Therefore, the lightning protection design requirement for ship should contain not only direct lightning protection but also lightning EMP protection. In this paper, the disserving characteristics of lightning to ship are investigated, as well as the direct lightning and LEMP protection design requirement for ship system are proposed.
__label__0, By expanding the radiation characteristics into phase modes, a coupling matrix is constructed to compensate for mutual coupling in uniform circular arrays with a center element. Relying on a limited number of phase modes, this matrix fully describes the dependency of the receive and transmit characteristics on azimuth angle, for a given elevation angle and for arbitrary terminations placed at the different antenna ports. A sample dual band uniform circular array with center element illustrates the use of the coupling matrix for direction of arrival estimation
__label__0, Protruding ears are the most common auricular deformities for which patients seek consultation. These deformities belong to the first degree dysplasias and result from an overdeveloped concha, an underdeveloped anthelix or a prominent lobule. Otoplastic techniques to correct these malformations are based on such surgical principles as suturing, incision, excision, scoring and burring of the auricular cartilage. By emphasizing these basic procedures the most useful techniques are described. Special importance is placed on the indications for surgery, basic principles and techniques used.
__label__0, Five patients of the pediatric age group are reported in whom defects in the liver scans appeared and persisted following abdominal irradiation for malignant disease. At least a part of the liver in each case had been included in the treatment fields.The single dose equivalent in each case was in the range of 1,400 r, and the 6 week equivalent dose, 4,250 r.In all cases, a sample of the area of liver affected was examined histologically and demonstrated the primary lesion to be hepatic venous obstruction at the sublobular level.The liven scanning and histopathologic changes reported are further evidence that the liver is a more radiosensitive organ than previously believed.
__label__0, This paper introduces a least squares, matrix based framework for adaptive filtering that includes normalized LMS, affine projection, and recursive least squares as special cases. We then introduce other transform domain based methods and show how to create optimal low rank versions. We also discuss efficient implementation of our method and its use in an echo canceller.
__label__0, Perfect bases for equational theories are closely related to confluent and finitely terminating term rewrite systems. The two classes have a large overlap, but neither contains the other. The class of perfect bases is recursive. We also investigate a common generalization of both concepts; we call these more general bases normal, and touch the question of their uniqueness. We also give numerous examples.
__label__0, While a number of researchers have published results in the area of parallel robot singularity determination and the a posteriori elimination of these singularities, far less work has been published in the area of singularity free workspace design. Several researchers have committed substantial funds to design hardware prototypes that have proven worthless because of unavoidable singularities. This trend, if carried over to industrial applications, could prove especially detrimental to the future of applied parallel robotics. A comprehensive and straightforward design strategy that guarantees a singularity free workspace for the translational 3-UPU mechanism is presented in this paper.
__label__0, Recent releases of Saxon support XQuery 1.0 as well as XSLT 2.0. However, the XQuery processor is an in-memory processor, not a database query engine. Optimizing database queries is an entirely different art, because it relies so heavily on rearranging queries to exploit persistent indexes. An in-memory processor does not have this opportunity, because the only indexes available are those that are constructed transiently for the duration of a transformation or query.

__label__0, This paper introduces segmentation-based 3D non-photorealistic rendering, in which 3D scenes are rendered as a collection of 2D image segments. Segments abstract out unnecessary detail and provide a basis for defining new rendering styles. These segments are computed by a spectral clustering algorithm that incorporates 3D information, including depth, user-defined importance, and object grouping. Temporally coherent animation is created by biasing adjacent frames to have similar segmentations. We describe algorithms for rendering segments in styles inspired by a number of hand-painted images.

__label__0, With a shift from central to decentralized generation, the question arises whether renewable energy sources can contribute to the provision of ancillary services and to which extent. This work assesses the effects of reactive power provision from wind turbines connected to the 110 kV distribution grid on redispatch cost. For this purpose a redispatch model is developed that does not only consider thermal line limits, but also voltage stability. Calculations show that especially in situations with very high wind feed-in, reactive power provision from the distribution grid is able to decrease redispatch and curtailment cost.
__label__0, The induction coil launcher is one kind of devices that can push forward the armature with the electromagnetic energy. In the course of emission, the drive coil and armature will suffer very big reacting force, so they may be ruptured or destroyed which affect the normal work of the whole induction coil launcher. It is very complex to analyze the generation and affection course of the stress in the induction coil launcher and it is also difficult to calculate. So, the paper uses finite element method to analyze the stress in the induction coil launcher. In the course of calculation, inherent stress, electromagnetic force stress and temperature stress are considered. At last, stress distribution of induction coil launcher is obtained by calculation.

__label__0, Prostaglandins are now extensively used for abortions and for inducing labour in all three trimesters of pregnancy. Owing to the side-effects associated with parenteral administration, preference is now given to local application. This, however, may also give rise to an extreme or inadequate stimulation of the uterus. Therefore, therapeutic procedures capable of effectively influencing exogenous PGF2-alpha-induced uterine contractions and even spontaneous hyperergic uterine contractions are of clinical importance. Theoretically, methylxanthine derivatives may be used in view of their well-known smooth muscle relaxant effect.
__label__0, The voltage waveform on the electric power distribution system is distorted by harmonic-producing loads. Regardless of the terminal voltage waveform with or without harmonics, the conventional current waveform of the pulsewidth-modulated converter systems connected to the power distribution system is always controlled to be sinusoidal. For harmonic suppression of the voltage and current on the distribution system, the authors propose the distorted current waveform whose harmonic components are in phase with the terminal voltage harmonics. The effectiveness of the proposed current waveform has been verified by experiments.

__label__0, In this paper, a method for localization and extraction of faces and characteristic facial features such as eyes, mouth and face boundaries from color image data is proposed. This approach exploits color properties of human skin to localize image regions - face candidates. The facial features extraction is performed only on prese- lected face-candidate regions. Likewise, for eyes and mouth localization color information and local contrast around eyes are used. The ellipse of face boundary is de- termined using gradient image and Hough transform. Algorithm was tested on image database Feret.

__label__0, To study diurnal differences in norepinephrine turnover, groups of rats were housed in rooms with alternating 12 h light and 12 h dark where half the animals were in a normal light cycle and half were in a reversed light cycle. Norepinephrine turnover was measured in all groups beginning at 1000 by inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. When rats are fed ad libitum, the turnover of norepinephrine in interscapular brown adipose tissue and heart was significantly higher in the normal cycle than in the reversed cycle. In addition, there was an interaction between the turnover of norepinephrine and the feeding and lighting schedules. When animals were adapted to eating from 0700 to 1900, the turnover of norepinephrine was somewhat faster when the animals ate in the reversed cycle than when they ate in the normal cycle. Conversely, when the feeding schedule was reversed and animals ate between 1900 and 0700, the turnover of norepinephrine in the absence of food was slightly slower in the animals eating in the reversed cycle than in those eating in the light cycle. This interaction between lighting and food intake observed in both male and female rats was abolished by ventromedial hypothalamic lesions. These data suggest that food intake and lighting conditions interact as controllers of the sympathetic nervous system and that these interactions are modulated by the ventromedial hypothalamus.
__label__0, A new paradigm for disease diagnosis and treatment is emerging that will bring about changes in health care delivery in and out of the hospital setting. Over the past several decades, genomic medicine has been one of the fastest growing fields in acute and chronic health care. This quick growth has created a lag in genomics knowledge and preparation among nurses and health care providers. Genomic medicine may lead to more precise evaluation, diagnosis, and management of selected acute care conditions. This article reviews the current state of genetic and genomics science and looks at the expanding field of genomic medicine's integration into precision medicine. The aim of this article is to raise awareness and spark further inquiry to the remarkable field of genomics and precision medicine.

__label__0, How do we find what we are looking for? A target can be in plain view, but it may be detected only after extensive search. During a search we make directed attentional deployments like saccades to segment the scene until we detect the target. Depending on difficulty, the search may be fast with few attentional deployments or slow with many, shorter deployments. Here we study visual search in barn owls by tracking their overt attentional deployments-that is, their head movements-with a camera. We conducted a low-contrast feature search, a high-contrast orientation conjunction search, and a low-contrast orientation conjunction search, each with set sizes varying from 16 to 64 items. The barn owls were able to learn all of these tasks and showed serial search behavior. In a subsequent step, we analyzed how search behavior of owls changes with search complexity. We compared the search mechanisms in these three serial searches with results from pop-out searches our group had reported earlier. Saccade amplitude shortened and fixation duration increased in difficult searches. Also, in conjunction search saccades were guided toward items with shared target features. These data suggest that during visual search, barn owls utilize mechanisms similar to those that humans use.

__label__0, In order to facilitate automated reasoning about large Boolean combinations of nonlinear arithmetic constraints involving transcendental functions, we provide a tight integration of recent SAT solving techniques with interval-based arithmetic constraint solving. Our approach deviates substantially from lazy theorem proving approaches in that it directly controls arithmetic constraint propagation from the SAT solver rather than delegating arithmetic decisions to a subordinate solver. Through this tight integration, all the algorithmic enhancements that were instrumental to the enormous performance gains recently achieved in propositional SAT solving carry over smoothly to the rich domain of nonlinear arithmetic constraints. As a consequence, our approach is able to handle large constraint systems with extremely complex Boolean structure, involving Boolean combinations of multiple thousand arithmetic constraints over some thousands of variables.
__label__0, Finland has enacted a Biobank Act that will come into force on 1 September 2013. Finland is regarded as a highly successful environment for medical research using population samples and data for many reasons. One of the rationales behind the new legislation was to solve the problems due to the overly strict informed consent doctrine hindering access to old samples and data and asking for multi-purpose consents. Yet although consent is the primary justification to use biobank samples and data, the Biobank Act allows asking for a consent for several unspecified future research purposes. The guiding principles of the Biobank Act are promotion of trust, equal access to data and samples, protection of privacy, acceleration of innovation activities, and bringing biobank activities under public scrutiny. To the author's knowledge, this is the first "all purpose" Biobank Act in Europe applied to all biobanks in one country.
__label__0, Postkeratoplasty astigmatism is now a major problem preventing visual recovery. Certain postoperative topographic characteristics are felt to be dictated by the fit of the donor corneal button in its recipient bed. Deficient tissue at the wound is predicted to contribute to the location of the steep meridian and excess tissue to the location of the flat meridian. In an eight-cat sample using our Fit Assessment Method and Photogrammetric Index Method, the authors tested the relationship between button fit in recipient bed and resulting corneal curvature at approximately 42, 161, and 289 postoperative days. Corneal symmetry improved between the first and second postoperative periods. Deficient tissue led to steepened curvature and ample tissue to flattened curvature in the first measurement period. When buttons fit poorly, deficient tissue led to steepness in the first postoperative period, but led to flattened curvature 90 deg away from the deficient tissue meridian in the second and third periods. The relationship between ample tissue and flattest postoperative curvature did not depend on the magnitude of button-fed disparity in any period. Corneal elasticity appeared to influence the way tissue disparity affected postoperative topography. Our findings support Troutman's balloon mode. When there was a large amount of uncompensated tissue disparity, the tissue deficiency exerted a force that shortened the translimbal chord. This produced both steepened curvature parallel to this chord soon after surgery and flattened curvature at 90 deg to the chord in the stable postoperative cornea.

__label__0, Statistical models, such as the Ising model, have been proven to be very useful in describing solid state systems in physics. Furthermore, these models have been applied to a variety of problems in engineering, chemistry, biology and more, without losing their effectiveness, simplicity and intuitiveness. In this paper we present a clear analogy between the different research fields and a general method for utilizing these models. In a previous work, we introduced a novel Ising-like model and used it in order to restore colored images and videos damaged by various kinds of noise. In this work, we elaborate on important improvements to the restoration algorithm that result in significantly better restorations. Most of the improvements are obtained as a combination of both better physical models and well known image restoration techniques. In particular, the proposed model tests the noisy image automatically and chooses the appropriate model parameters accordingly, on a physical basis, without the need for manual support. Moreover, an automatic analysis of the image histogram is performed, suggesting which pixels are the damaged pixels that need to be restored. In comparison to our previous model, the new model is shown to be not only automatic but also faster. The calculated PSNR and SSIM parameters are better than those achieved previously, as well as by other common filters. Together with the successful results, the disadvantages and limitations of statistical models, such as the Ising model, are discussed as well.
__label__0, Self-tracking technologies have been developed to understand the self. Emotions are critical to understanding one's daily life; however, tracking the emotion is challenging due to the implicit form of data. In this paper, we introduce MindTracker, an approach for tracking emotion through a tangible interaction with plasticine clay. We explored the benefits and challenges of MindTracker via a two-week data collection study with 16 college students as well as via interviews with three clinical mental health experts. MindTracker is designed for users to craft a form that represents emotion using clay and to describe the experience that evokes the emotion using a diary. We found that the tangible modality of MindTracker motivated the participants to express various aspects of emotions. In addition, MindTracker's data collection and reflection process could have therapeutic properties, such as expressive therapy, self-soothing, and emotional self-regulation. We conclude this paper by discussing the design features of emotion-tracking tools and opportunities to use MindTracker to promote mental health.

These services would usually be guided by developmentalists in a child study center, who are in close alliance with the medical, educational, and community service components of child and family care. Concerns about the infectiousness of these children are manageable and not a major threat in the setting of developmental services.
__label__0, The efficacy of an inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine against Mycoplasma agalactiae was evaluated by an experimental infection of sheep. The vaccinated sheep developed high levels of antibodies and, following challenge, they did not develop any clinical signs of disease and the mycoplasmas were not detected, either by isolation trials or PCR assays carried out both on nasal swabs and milk specimens. The unvaccinated-challenged sheep showed typical signs of M. agalactiae infection and bacterial shedding. The results obtained indicate a good efficacy of the vaccine in eliciting protection against M. agalactiae infection.
__label__0, As LoRaWAN networks are actively being deployed in the field, it is important to comprehend the limitations of this low power wide area network technology. Previous work has raised questions in terms of the scalability and capacity of LoRaWAN networks as the number of end devices grows to hundreds or thousands per gateway. Some works have modeled LoRaWAN networks as pure ALOHA networks, which fails to capture important characteristics such as the capture effect and the effects of interference. Other works provide a more comprehensive model by relying on empirical and stochastic techniques. This paper uses a different approach where a LoRa error model is constructed from extensive complex baseband bit error rate simulations and used as an interference model. The error model is combined with the LoRaWAN MAC protocol in an ns-3 module that enables to study multichannel, multispreading factor, multigateway, bi-directional LoRaWAN networks with thousands of end devices. Using the LoRaWAN ns-3 module, a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN shows the detrimental impact downstream traffic has on the delivery ratio of confirmed upstream traffic. The analysis shows that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but not eliminate this effect, as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways continue to limit downstream opportunities.
__label__0, Evaluation is an important aspect of staff development service. However, it is frequently overlooked or superflcially addressed in staff development quality management programs. This article emphasizes the importance of multilevel evaluation techniques to assure quality education and promote effective use of staff development resources.

__label__0, In a man-plane-weapons system, the limiting factor in the success of a mission often is ascribable to the human element. This limitation is sometimes referable to the cardiovascular system, and coronary heart disease poses the most important single problem. We are concerned over the facts that coronary heart disease may limit the flier's career and that the occurrence of acute coronary incidents in pilots aloft constitutes a hazard. 1 Our inability to predict these incidents is at once frustrating and disturbing. We can deal only in the likelihood of their occurrence. In the case of hypertensive cardiovascular disease an indicator, hypertension, is present long in advance of circulatory failure. A comparable indicator, coronary atherosclerosis, rarely is detectable prior to involvement of the myocardium. Moreover, even in the presence of coronary artery disease, we know little concerning the factors which precipitate acute coronary incidents. Problems of the pilot must be considered
__label__0, Achieving space domain awareness requires the identification, characterization, and tracking of space objects. Storing and leveraging associated space object data for purposes such as hostile threat assessment, object identification, and collision prediction and avoidance present further challenges. Space objects are characterized according to a variety of parameters including their identifiers, design specifications, components, subsystems, capabilities, vulnerabilities, origins, missions, orbital elements, patterns of life, processes, operational statuses, and associated persons, organizations, or nations. The Space Object Ontology provides a consensus-based realist framework for formulating such characterizations in a computable fashion. Space object data are aligned with classes and relations in the Space Object Ontology and stored in a dynamically updated Resource Description Framework triple store, which can be queried to support space domain awareness and the needs of spacecraft operators. This paper presents the core of the Space Object Ontology, discusses its advantages over other approaches to space object classification, and demonstrates its ability to combine diverse sets of data from multiple sources within an expandable framework. Finally, we show how the ontology provides benefits for enhancing and maintaining long-term space domain awareness.
__label__0, Psychiatry is facing a crisis fueled by a fragmented and inefficient system of care delivery and a disconnection between the state of research and the state of psychiatry education and practice. Many factors contribute to the current state of psychiatric care. Psychiatry is a shortage specialty, and this will become worse in the near future. In addition, financial pressures have led to decreases in psychiatric inpatient and outpatient services and to shorter lengths of hospitalization for even the sickest patients. This has resulted in fragmented care and an overreliance on polypharmacy. To reach the large number of patients needing psychiatric services, health care systems must change and take advantage of collaborative and integrative care models and new technologies. Psychiatrists must learn to partner more effectively with primary care providers to extend their expertise to the greatest number of patients. Currently, psychiatric diagnosis is based on a criteria-based system that was developed in the 1970s. Advances in systems and molecular neuroscience are beginning to elucidate specific brain systems that are dysfunctional in psychiatric illness. This has the potential to revolutionize psychiatric diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, psychiatry has not yet been successful in incorporating the language of this research into clinically meaningful terminology. If neuroscientific progress is to be translated into clinical advances, this must change. Residency programs must better prepare their graduates to keep up with a psychiatry literature that will increasingly use the language of neural circuits to describe psychiatric symptomatology and treatments.
__label__0,   Laparoscopy seems to be the ideal method of sterilization for women over 40. In a series of 60 cases over a 3 year period the author did not observe any complication or failure. Laparoscopy can very effectively be used to better evaluate the clinical situation prior to operation for tubal sterility. In such cases laparoscopy enables to check for the absence of peritoneal tuberculosis, and of pelvi-peritoneal adhesions. In a series of 26 patients, the author obtained, after operation, 11 pregnancies, 8 spontaneous abortions, 1 ectopic pregnancy, and 4 operative failures. The results obtained with other similar series are presented. Laparoscopy prior to operation for sterility can also give a better idea of the postoperative treatment to be followed. 
__label__0, The SOS response is the primary bacterial mechanism to address DNA damage, coordinating multiple cellular processes that include DNA repair, cell division, and translesion synthesis. In contrast to other regulatory systems, the composition of the SOS genetic network and the binding motif of its transcriptional repressor, LexA, have been shown to vary greatly across bacterial clades, making it an ideal system to study the co-evolution of transcription factors and their regulons. Leveraging comparative genomics approaches and prior knowledge on the core SOS regulon, here we define the binding motif of the Verrucomicrobia, a recently described phylum of emerging interest due to its association with eukaryotic hosts. Site directed mutagenesis of the Verrucomicrobium spinosum recA promoter confirms that LexA binds a 14 bp palindromic motif with consensus sequence TGTTC-N4-GAACA. Computational analyses suggest that recognition of this novel motif is determined primarily by changes in base-contacting residues of the third alpha helix of the LexA helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. In conjunction with comparative genomics analysis of the LexA regulon in the Verrucomicrobia phylum, electrophoretic shift assays reveal that LexA binds to operators in the promoter region of DNA repair genes and a mutagenesis cassette in this organism, and identify previously unreported components of the SOS response. The identification of tandem LexA-binding sites generating instances of other LexA-binding motifs in the lexA gene promoter of Verrucomicrobia species leads us to postulate a novel mechanism for LexA-binding motif evolution. This model, based on gene duplication, successfully addresses outstanding questions in the intricate co-evolution of the LexA protein, its binding motif and the regulatory network it controls.
__label__0, In the first year of the operation of a domiciliary family planning service 50 deprived families accepted contraceptive advice offered in their homes. Associated factors were poverty, unemployment, overcrowding, alcoholism, debt, and disease. The women had previously averaged one pregnancy every 19 months but during the period under review there were only two pregnancies, in contrast to the 37 that would otherwise have been expected. Though the service is expensive in professional time, the overall saving in costs to the community by the prevention of unwanted pregnancies in socially inadequate families fully justifies the scheme.
__label__0, and literature quoted in this paper, lead to the conclusion, that the human factor is the main cause of failure and challenges of IS projects. Authors concede, that motivation is the only feasible instrument in the hands of an IS project manager, to challenge the productivity of team members. A systematic approach evaluates the motivating and demotivating factors. The four phase model of the IS project management is justified in view of any team members' motivation. The processes of human factor management in IS projects are uniquely classified and described along the L-timer TM project management method. Completeness of processes and simplicity of the timer analogy shall support project manager in the navigation among hundreds of tasks, which he is supposed to pursue. The motivating activities in each process are named. Awareness is awakened where a negative influence on team motivation might happen. Recognition, rewards, useful goals and challenging assignments are named as the most efficient motivators. Consequently the professionalism of the project manager in psychology, team, communication and leadership is considered as important as his IS knowledge. Further research objectives and a comprehensive bibliography close the paper.

We consider the inverse scattering problem for the identification of the layers and of the refraction coefficients of the scatterer in a non-Born region of scattering. Local deterministic and global probabilistic minimization methods are studied. A special reduction procedure is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the minimization space. Deep's and the multilevel single-linkage methods for global minimization are used for the solution of the inverse problem. Their performance is analyzed for various multilayer configurations.
__label__0, Differential resource use allows a diversity of species to co-exist in a particular area by specializing in individual ecological niches. Four-horned antelope Tetracerus quadricornis is endemic to the Indian subcontinent and has a restricted distribution in Nepal and India; however, the barking deer Muntiacus vaginalis is relatively common throughout its wide distribution range. We wanted a better understanding of their habitats and how these two similarly sized solitary ungulates manage to coexist in lowland Nepal. We used fecal pellet belt transect surveys in the Babai valley, Bardia National Park to study the habitat associations of both species. We found empirical evidence that four-horned antelope prefer hill sal forest and deciduous hill forest at higher elevations, whereas barking deer preferred riverine and sal forest in lower elevations. We found a clear niche differentiation of four-horned antelope and barking deer that made the coexistence of these similarly sized solitary ungulates possible. Hence, resource partitioning is the key to coexistence of these solitary ungulates, and the fine-grained habitat mosaic of different forest types in the study landscape appears to be the underlying feature. Therefore, maintaining the habitat mosaic and preserving valuable hill sal and deciduous hill forests will facilitate the coexistence of herbivores in sub-tropical regions.

__label__0, We present a new technique for passive and markerless facial performance capture based on anchor frames. Our method starts with high resolution per-frame geometry acquisition using state-of-the-art stereo reconstruction, and proceeds to establish a single triangle mesh that is propagated through the entire performance. Leveraging the fact that facial performances often contain repetitive subsequences, we identify anchor frames as those which contain similar facial expressions to a manually chosen reference expression. Anchor frames are automatically computed over one or even multiple performances. We introduce a robust image-space tracking method that computes pixel matches directly from the reference frame to all anchor frames, and thereby to the remaining frames in the sequence via sequential matching. This allows us to propagate one reconstructed frame to an entire sequence in parallel, in contrast to previous sequential methods. Our anchored reconstruction approach also limits tracker drift and robustly handles occlusions and motion blur. The parallel tracking and mesh propagation offer low computation times. Our technique will even automatically match anchor frames across different sequences captured on different occasions, propagating a single mesh to all performances.

In this paper, we design a linear phase impulse response filter to reconstruct the quality of the bone-conducted speech signal obtained from a speaker. The bone-conducted speech observation as well as the normal speech information is effectively utilized to design the filter. From experimental results, the properties of the reconstruction filter are investigated.
__label__0, A marked sensitivity of CLL lymphocytes to hydrocortisone in vitro was demonstrated in each of the 25 patients tested. The sensitivity was manifested by the eventual lysis of the affected cells. Malignant lymphocytes from 8 out of 14 ALL patients were found also to be in vitro sensitive, whereas CML cells, AML cells, normal BM cells, thymocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells were resistant. Within a tested CLL lymphoid suspension it is proven that the hydrocortisone causes the specific lysis of the malignant cells leaving the normal lymphocytes undamaged. The cytolysis is not an immediate action, but is expressed within 7-8 hr of incubation. However, 30 min incubation with the hormone is sufficient for the cytolytic effect to occur 20 hr later. The possible mechanisms involved in the specific glucocorticoid induced cytolysis are discussed.
__label__0, Signal transduction pathways play essential roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Their precise regulation is achieved through specific protein-protein interactions that mediate the assembly of protein complexes in response to different signals. Disturbances of the normal protein-protein interactions within signaling pathways can lead to many diseases, including cancer. In this review, Stagljar aims to highlight the emerging protein interaction technologies that are advancing the field of signal transduction. These approaches include stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SH2 profiling, target-assisted iterative screening, and the split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid system. Although still at an early stage, these technologies show promise as useful methods for the characterization of novel components of various signal transduction pathways.
__label__0, This work investigates singularities occurring at finite real times in the classical dynamics of one-dimensional double-well systems with complex initial conditions. The objective is to understand the relationship between these singularities and the behavior of the systems for real initial conditions. An analytical treatment establishes that the dynamics of a quartic double well system possesses a doubly infinite sequence of singularities. These are associated with initial conditions that converge to those for the real separatrix as the singularity time becomes infinite. This confluence of singularities is shown to lead to the unstable behavior that characterizes the real motion at the separatrix. Numerical calculations confirm the existence of a large number of singularities converging to the separatrix for this and two additional double-well systems. The approach of singularities to the real axis is of particular interest since such behavior has been related to the formation of chaos in nonintegrable systems. The properties of the singular trajectories which cause this convergence to the separatrix are identified. The hyperbolic fixed point corresponding to the potential energy maximum, responsible for the characteristic motion at a separatrix, also plays a critical role in the formation of the complex singularities by delaying trajectories and then deflecting them into asymptotic regions of space from where they are directly repelled to infinity in a finite time.
__label__0, Natural physical conditions and the politics of flood management provide the historical context for structural flood control that underlies modern flood hazards in the Sacramento Valley. The valley is a broad, low plain with backswamp basins that were frequently inundated prior to Anglo-American settlement, continuing until the modern flood-control system was established. Early attempts to emulate the Mississippi River single-channel levee strategy failed repeatedly in the Sacramento Valley due to high flow variability, mining sedimentation, lack of a coordinated levee system, and the inability of the main channels to carry most of the flood flows. Hydraulic mining caused massive sedimentation in major east-side tributaries, such as the Feather, Yuba, Bear, and American Rivers, and in the Sacramento River below the Feather River confluence. This sedimentation led to a flood-control design that relied on levees with narrow cross-channel spacings to promote channel scour and facilitate navigation. Even with...
__label__0, ABSTRACT The gene encoding p53 mediates a major tumor suppression pathway that is frequently altered in human cancers. p53 function is kept at a low level during normal cell growth and is activated in response to various cellular stresses. The MDM2 oncoprotein plays a key role in negatively regulating p53 activity by either direct repression of p53 transactivation activity in the nucleus or promotion of p53 degradation in the cytoplasm. DNA damage and oncogenic insults, the two best-characterized p53-dependent checkpoint pathways, both activate p53 through inhibition of MDM2. Here we report that the human homologue of MDM2, HDM2, binds to ribosomal protein L11. L11 binds a central region in HDM2 that is distinct from the ARF binding site. We show that the functional consequence of L11-HDM2 association, like that with ARF, results in the prevention of HDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, subsequently restoring p53-mediated transactivation, accumulating p21 protein levels, and inducing a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest by canceling the inhibitory function of HDM2. Interference with ribosomal biogenesis by a low concentration of actinomycin D is associated with an increased L11-HDM2 interaction and subsequent p53 stabilization. We suggest that L11 functions as a negative regulator of HDM2 and that there might exist in vivo an L11-HDM2-p53 pathway for monitoring ribosomal integrity.
__label__0, The influence of leu-enkephalin and dalargin on the blood system was studied during immobilization stress in mice. The early transmitted reactions of the peripheral blood were shown to decrease upon single drug infusions after immobilization. At later terms the activation of bone marrow hematopoiesis was not registered in mice receiving opioid peptides in contrast to the control animals. It correlates with drug-induced decrease in the mitotic activity of bone-marrow cells. Suppressive effect of opioids on hematopoiesis during stress was connected with their decreasing effect on corticosteroid level in the animal plasma. The latter can suggest indirect influence of enkephalins on bone marrow hematopoiesis in immobilization stress.
__label__0, The celiac axis compression syndrome caused by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm is an exceedingly rare clinical entity, coursing with postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. Despite the original description made some decades ago, its existence is still challenged by some authors, due to a weak clinicopathological correlation and inconstant results obtained with its surgical management. The authors report the case of a 35 years old female with the clinical presentation above described, who underwent an exhaustive investigation in gastroenterology, leading to the diagnosis, made by CT-scans and conventional angiography, of celiac axis compression syndrome by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm. A definitive surgical repair was performed, consisting in the ligament division, followed by resection and replacement of the celiac axis, by a 6 mms PTFE grafts. The post-operative course was uneventful and reviewed one month later, the patient was found in excellent condition and completely free of symptoms. Pathological studies of the celiac axis disclosed significant proliferative and degenerative lesions of the arterial wall, consequence of the compression mechanism, a fact that has not been reported in previous similar publications. The main feature of this unique clinical entity and its surgical management are discussed, based on a review of the most recent publications of the literature.
__label__0, a new optimum topology dc-todc switching converter is extended to provide bidirectional current flow. The resulting two-quadrant converter can be employed to eliminate the discontinuous curent mode in normal unidirectional applications, but is especially suited for spacecraft battery conditioning as a charge-discharge regulator in place of the conventional separate converters. Implementation of the control features and the battery charge current and voltage limits are discussed.
__label__0, Osteoarthritis is a common disease that constitutes a considerable socioeconomic burden. So far no radiological procedure was available that allowed the disease to be detected in an early stage. Monitoring disease progression and efficacy of therapeutic procedures was also not possible.We present a measuring procedure and describe evaluation tools that are based on 3D computed tomography. The procedure provides quantitative data on pathological features known to be associated with osteoarthritis such as subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, joint space narrowing, and bone lesions. It is fully three dimensional, the results are operator independent and describe global as well as local parameters. Changes in these parameters are evaluated from differential images. For that purpose a 3D matching procedure based on translation and rotation-specific correlation techniques is used that allows a repositioning of the bone objects with a mismatch of less than 0.3 mm with regard to translations and 0.250 with regard to rotations.The use of the new tools for measurement, repositioning and evaluation is illustrated with the results from a clinical study. Patients with mild osteoarthritis of the knee joint, healthy controls and osteoporotic patients, all in the same age range of 60 to 75 years, were examined during three years. The cortical to trabecular bone ratio describing subchondral sclerosis proved to be especially helpful to distinguish early osteoarthritic cases from age matched controls. Disease progression is best shown by the increase in the number of detected bone lesions, a reduction of the mean distance between femur and tibia and an increase in the cortical to trabecular bone ratio. Hence the presented procedure appears to have a great potential in diagnosis and treatment monitoring of osteoarthritis.
__label__0, An important control point for gene regulation is the frequency of initiations leading to different numbers of RNA polymerases simultaneously transcribing the same gene. To date, the only direct assay for multiple-round transcription by RNA polymerase II in vitro required G-free cassette-containing templates and GTP-free conditions and was thus restricted in application. Here we used instead templates containing a triplex-directed interstrand psoralen-DNA cross-link to block RNA polymerase II elongation at a specific location. Covalently cross-linked templates allowed simultaneous detection of both specific initiation and reinitiation with any combination of promoter and transcribed sequence. In reconstituted systems, identical stacking of RNA polymerases was observed when the first polymerase was halted by GTP deprivation at the end of a G-free cassette or by a covalent cross-link downstream of different transcribed sequences. In contrast to transcription of G-free cassettes, reinitiation was unaffected by the transcription factor SII on sequences containing all four nucleotides. In crude nuclear extracts, transcription of covalently cross-linked templates yielded a reinitiation pattern with a wider spacing than in more purified fractions, indicating that the elongation complexes from nuclear extract contained a different form of RNA polymerase II or a different complement of associated factors.

The versatility and accuracy of the method is illustrated by applications to dewetting of a hard sphere solute in a Lennard-Jones fluid, the interplay between local hydrogen bond structure and electrostatics for water confined between two hydrophobic walls, and to ion pairing in ionic solutions. Simulation time has been reduced by more than an order of magnitude over previous methods.
__label__0, Class imbalanced data is a common problem for predictive modelling in domains such as bioinformatics. It occurs when the distribution of classes is not uniform among samples and results in a biased prediction of learning towards majority classes. In this study, we propose the ABC-Sampling algorithm based on a swarm optimization method called Artificial Bee Colony, which models the natural foraging behaviour of honeybees. Our algorithm lessens the effects of imbalanced classes by selecting the most informative majority samples using a forward search and storing them in a ranked subset. Then we construct a balanced dataset with a planned undersampling strategy to extract the most frequent majority samples from the top ranked subset and combine them with all minority samples. Our algorithm is superior to a state-of-the-art method on nine benchmark datasets with various levels of imbalance ratios.

__label__0, Self expandable metal stent can be used both as palliative treatment for malignant colorectal obstruction and as a bridge to surgery in patients with potentially resectable colorectal cancer. Here, we report a case of successful relief of malignant stomal obstruction using a metal stent. A 56-year-old man underwent loop ileostomy and was given palliative chemotherapy for ascending colon cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Eight months after the surgery, he complained of abdominal pain and decreased fecal output. Computed tomography and endoscopy revealed malignant stomal obstruction. Due to his poor clinical condition, we inserted the stent at the stomal orifice, instead of additional surgery, and his obstructive symptoms were successfully relieved. Stent insertion is thought to be a good alternative treatment for malignant stomal obstruction, instead of surgery.
__label__0, Results are presented for a ductile metal reinforced bulk metallic glass matrix composite based on glass forming compositions in the Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni-Be system. Primary dendrite growth and solute partitioning in the molten state yields a microstructure consisting of a ductile crystalline Ti-Zr-Nb beta phase, with bcc structure, in a Zr-Ti-Nb-Cu-Ni-Be bulk metallic glass matrix. Under unconstrained mechanical loading organized shear band patterns develop throughout the sample. This results in a dramatic increase in the plastic strain to failure, impact resistance, and toughness of the metallic glass.

A case of congenital fibrosis of the inferior rectus muscles with severe chin-up posture and bilateral limitation of up gaze is reported. Bilateral large recessions of the tight inferior rectus muscles provided only partial improvement. Residual head posture and hypotropia were successfully corrected with bilateral horizontal rectus muscle transpositions toward the superior rectus muscles, despite persistently tight inferior rectus muscles at the time of surgery.
__label__0, Most existing subspace analysis-based tracking algorithms utilize a flattened vector to represent a target, resulting in a high dimensional data learning problem. Recently, subspace analysis is incorporated into the multilinear framework which offline constructs a representation of image ensembles using high-order tensors. This reduces spatio-temporal redundancies substantially, whereas the computational and memory cost is high. In this paper, we present an effective online tensor subspace learning algorithm which models the appearance changes of a target by incrementally learning a low-order tensor eigenspace representation through adaptively updating the sample mean and eigenbasis. Tracking then is led by the state inference within the framework in which a particle filter is used for propagating sample distributions over the time. A novel likelihood function, based on the tensor reconstruction error norm, is developed to measure the similarity between the test image and the learned tensor subspace model during the tracking. Theoretic analysis and experimental evaluations against a state-of-the-art method demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of this algorithm.
__label__0, A simple method for classifying subjects as slow or rapid inactivators of isoniazid has been described. A uniform dose of 300 mg. of ordinary isoniazid was administered orally to 150 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The ratio of acetylisoniazid to isoniazid was determined in urine collected at hourly intervals from 4 to 8 h. At each hour the distribution of the ratios was clearly bimodal. The test based on the 5-6h, urine collection is recommended for its convenience and excellent discrimination between slow and rapid inactivators. The agreement between this method and a standard method was of the order of 97 per cent.

__label__0, This article assesses the desirability of our current, arms' length based, transfer pricing regime by analyzing its theoretical and practical effectiveness in application to transfers of intangibles. A detailed analysis of the practice of valuation of intangibles, which is the key component in the application of this regime, exposes its weaknesses that result in undesirable market incentives. These incentives create a strong bias in favor of large multinational enterprises, yet, even if one favored such bias, it is achieved using an uncontrollable, costly and wasteful legal mechanism. The article particularly criticizes the regime's disregard of the unique characteristics of intangibles that make them difficult to valuate; its disregard of the differences between types of intangibles; and its extraordinary narrow and limited approach to valuation. The article demonstrates that the undesirable reliance of our transfer pricing regime on the arms' length principle is the primary reason for the grim picture portrayed, and therefore advocates its replacement with a formula-based regime. The article's contribution in this regard is the argument that it is not only practically more desirable and less costly, but that it is also more coherent and natural to our general international tax regime; therefore, in terms of design, transfer pricing reform should take into account the basic premises of such regime. Some of the criticism and conclusions of this article are about our general transfer pricing regime, while the analysis is limited to the valuation of intangibles' aspects, yet, since this is probably the area that presents the most acute challenge to the current regime, so building upon it may be an important step towards reform.
__label__0, The renal lesions of serum sickness were studied with the electron microscope. The most prominent change was a marked swelling and proliferation of glomernlar endothelial cells causing obliteration of the capillary lumen. The basement membrane also showed focal thickenings and excrescences. Deposits of electron-dense material blended into the basement membrane. On the extracapillary side epithelial foot processes were reduced in number and replaced by broad sheets of cytoplasm which were closely applied to the basement membrane. From a comparison of electron and fluorescent microscopic studies of the glomerulus in serum sickness, it would seem that antigen-antibody complexes initiated injury in endothelial cells, although the possibility of the primary reaction occurring on basement membrane cannot be excluded.
__label__0, We propose a model to automatically describe changes introduced in the source code of a program using natural language. Our method receives as input a set of code commits, which contains both the modifications and message introduced by an user. These two modalities are used to train an encoder-decoder architecture. We evaluated our approach on twelve real world open source projects from four different programming languages. Quantitative and qualitative results showed that the proposed approach can generate feasible and semantically sound descriptions not only in standard in-project settings, but also in a cross-project setting.
__label__0, Iron accumulation in the liver is frequently observed in hepatic diseases whatever their etiologies. In the majority of cases, there is no true overload, and iron accumulation corresponds to deposits in macrophages secondary to iron release from damaged hepatocytes. More rarely, namely in severe cirrhosis, there is a true overload, which is probably related to iron intestinal hyperabsorption. In such case, the site of iron excess is hepatocytic. Except for hemochromatosis, mutations of HFE gene do not play a major role in iron overload. In chronic liver diseases, iron overload could favor the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, even in the absence of cirrhosis.
__label__0, The purpose of this article is the consideration of the relation between the thoughts on hygiene and ideas of doctor training in the early Meiji era. There were two types of ideas on doctor training. One was the idea that a doctor should be a technocrat concerned with the health care of the people. Another was the idea that acknowledged the doctor's right to a paid practice. These two ideas were affected by the thoughts on health care for the people. The point of discussion is the clarification of the characteristics of the two types of ideas above mentioned.
__label__0, Some dentists feel insecure in the management of medical emergencies as it has been pointed out in the SMfZ already. The focus on a national investigation by means of questionnaire was the training supply in emergencies as well as the course attendance by dentists. The results of this investigation proved, that about half of the dentists, practicing in Switzerland keep themselves more or less up-to-date. They know about the right measures in case of an accident that may put vital functions at risk. However, this investigation also showed that we know little or nothing about the other half of practicing dentists in our country. In the last part of the paper a project of an e-learning course on medical emergencies in the dental office is disclosed.
__label__0, Because there are always non-line-of-sight effects in signal propagation, researchers have proposed various algorithms to mitigate the measured error caused by non-line-of-sight. Initially inspired by flocking birds, particle swarm optimization is an evolutionary computation tool for optimizing a problem by iteratively attempting to improve a candidate solution with respect to a given measure of quality. In this article, we propose a new location algorithm that uses time-of-arrival measurements to improve the mobile station location accuracy when three base stations are available. The proposed algorithm uses the intersections of three time-of-arrival circles based on the particle swarm optimization technique to give a location estimation of the mobile station in non-line-of-sight environments. An object function is used to establish the nonlinear relationship between the intersections of the three circles and the mobile station location. The particle swarm optimization finds the optimal solution of the object function and efficiently determines the mobile station location. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the related algorithms in wireless positioning systems, even in severe non-line-of-sight propagation conditions.

__label__0, Convalescent rehabilitation is a treatment designed to facilitate the process of recovery from disease or injury to as normal a condition as possible. The effective rehabilitation is required to improve functions to bring about the highest possible level of independence, physically, psychologically, socially and economically within a limited hospitalization period. Pain often inhibits the effective rehabilitation, and the pain management in the convalescent rehabilitation ward is important. In particular, it is important to evaluate the pain promptly and accurately, and to treat it by a multidisciplinary team approach, preventing a shift to chronic pain. In this article, we describe the role of each member in the convalescent rehabilitation team and the characteristic pains caused by representative diseases.
__label__0, This Paper computes welfare maximizing Taylor-style interest rate rules, in a business cycle model of a small open economy. The model assumes staggered price setting and shocks to domestic productivity, to the world interest rate, to world inflation and to the uncovered interest rate parity condition. Optimized policy rules have a pronounced anti-inflation stance and entail significant nominal and real exchange rate volatility. The country responds to an increase in external volatility by holding more foreign assets. The policy rule affects the variance and the mean of consumption. The effect on the mean matters significantly for welfare.

__label__0, Mobile, battery-powered devices such as personal digital assistants and web-enabled mobile phones have successfully emerged as new access points to the world's digital infrastructure. However, the growing gap between device capabilities and battery technology requires novel techniques that extend battery life. Key to the success of such techniques, is our ability to accurately predict the power consumption of a program. In this paper we investigate the degree to which battery dissipation induced by program execution can be measured by application-level software tools and predicted by a compiler and runtime system. We present a novel technique with which we can accurately estimate whole-program power-consumption for an arbitrary program by composing battery dissipation rates of benchmarks. We empirically evaluate our technique using an iPAQ hand-held device and a number of MiBench and other programs.
__label__0, Social network analysis has emerged as a set of methods for the analysis of social structures and uncovering the patterning of interactions among the entities. In the past, social network analysis was mainly a static investigation by considering independent graphs at different snapshots or one aggregated graph over the time period. However, for the dynamic social networks that change over time, the static analysis misses the opportunity to capture evolutionary patterns. A community is one of these patterns, and it is affected by changes in the underlying population in the dynamic social networks. In the literature there has been a considerable amount of work done to detect communities in social networks. However, the communities are independently detected at each snapshot regardless of the structural relationship between consecutive snapshots. In this paper we present a framework for modeling and detecting community evolution in social networks. This framework allows tracking of events related to communities as well as events related to individual nodes. These events can be considered as building blocks for pattern detection in networks with evolving communities. We illustrate the capabilities and potential of our framework by applying it to a real dataset consisting of emails from the Enron Corporation. The evolution of the Enron communities is detected with the events defined in our framework.

In order to realize united time, the united time service system or the time server must be established. Based on industrial wireless sensor networks, information fusion automatically analyzes and monitors information under the certain criterion. In this paper, based on industrial wireless sensor network, time synchronization technology and fault-tolerance strategy of time synchronization are studied and the error analyses are given, the time correct value algorithm and the analyses to the synchronization result are proposed. Result shows that this method is feasible and can be used to wireless sensor networks.
__label__0, The fields of applications and design for piezoelectric effect grew rapidly in recent years, and these materials play an important role in countless areas of modern life. There are few analysis and results for piezoelectric problems in periodic structures in composites. By means of two-scale method, the two-scale asymptotic expansions for the displacement and the potential for structure of composites with small periodic configuration under piezoelectric condition are constructed, and the coupled relation between the displacement field and the electric field within periodic cell is built, and the approximate errors of displacement and potential are presented. As a result, one new asymptotic method of computing approximate solutions of the displacement and the potential in periodic piezoelectric structure is proposed.

__label__0, OBJECTIVE To describe the pathologic features of two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome associated with trisomy 14 and to summarize the relevant literature.   RESULTS In both cases, trisomy 14 was identified using conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization methods. The patients were elderly men, 70 and 77 years old, who presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia. According to the French-American-British classification, case 1 was classified as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, and case 2 was classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In both cases, the aspirate smears revealed obvious abnormalities in erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation, with more subtle abnormalities in myeloid maturation. The biopsy sections were hypercellular, and there was marked myeloid hyperplasia in case 2. Both patients received only supportive therapy after the diagnosis was established. Clinical follow-up was available for both patients. The patient in case 1 died 67 months after disease onset of an unrelated illness, and the patient in case 2 was alive at last follow-up, 12 months after diagnosis.   LITERATURE REVIEW Thirty-five cases of trisomy 14 have been previously reported in the literature, predominantly in cytogenetics journals, and the description of the pathologic findings for the majority of these cases is limited or not provided. According to published data, the majority of these cases are myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemias associated with myelodysplasia.   CONCLUSIONS The detection of trisomy 14 in the bone marrow strongly correlates with the presence of a myelodysplastic syndrome. The two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome associated with trisomy 14 we describe here did not exhibit characteristic morphologic findings that might suggest the presence of the cytogenetic abnormality.
__label__0, In the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the transposition frequency of I factor, a LINE element-like retrotransposon, is regulated by the reactivity level of the R mother. This reactivity is a cellular state maternally inherited but chromosomally determined, which has been shown to undergo heritable, cumulative and reversible changes with aging and some environmental conditions. We propose the hypothesis that this reactivity level is one manifestation of an inducible repair-recombination system whose biological role might be analogous to the SOS response in bacteria. In this paper, we show that inhibitors of DNA synthesis and gamma rays enhance the reactivity level in a very similar way. This enhancement is heritable, cumulative and reversible.
__label__0, The origins of neurosurgical services in Atlantic Canada are tied to the individual efforts of William D. Stevenson. Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Stevenson completed his senior matriculation in Dunnville, Ontario, before studying medicine at the University of Toronto. He completed the Gallie surgical course in Toronto and then spent 1 year training with Edward Archibald at McGill University. After working for 2 years with the Canadian Mobile Neurosurgical Unit in Europe during the Second World War, Stevenson undertook formal neurosurgical training with Kenneth G. McKenzie, Canada's first neurosurgeon. Stevenson was thereafter recruited to Halifax to start the neurosurgical service at the Victoria General Hospital in January 1948, and he remained head of the division for the next 26 years. His pioneering work laid the foundations for the establishment of a major academic neurosurgical service at Dalhousie University and was crucial for the establishment of neurosurgery in Atlantic Canada. After his retirement, Stevenson moved back to Ontario and began his second career, transferring his passion for neurosurgery to oil painting. His legacy to neurosurgery in Atlantic Canada will be remembered in perpetuity with the annual Neurosurgery Resident Research Award at Dalhousie University, established and named in his honour. This paper focuses on Stevenson's life and work in neurosurgery as Atlantic Canada's first neurosurgeon.
__label__0, 190 cases of maxillary sinusitis with retention of secretions were treated by frequent irrigation through an irrigation tube inserted via inferior turbinate sinus. The technique of the tube insertion through a Lichtwitz needle is described. Repeated irrigations do not need any anaesthesia and are better approved by the patients than the usual puncture irrigation. The response seems to be at least equally good as has been observed in similar patient series by repeated puncture irrigations. The patients' requests of reinsertion of irrigation tube in cases of recurrencies gives addition support to the recommendation to accept such a therapy.
__label__0, Requantization is one of the tools for bit-rate reduction of pre-encoded video to adapt it to various network bandwidth constraints. Several recent works propose using Lagrangian optimization to find the optimal quantization step for each coded macro-block, to meet a desired rate at minimum distortion. In this paper we propose to extend the Lagrangian optimization procedure by allowing the modification of quantized coefficients values, including setting their values to zero, in addition to quantization step-size selection. Coefficient value modification and quantization step-size selection are optimally done using a low complexity trellis-based procedure. The proposed requantization algorithm provides higher PSNR values than the Lagrangian-based optimization method that only handles the selection of quantization steps, and still does not exceed considerably its complexity.
__label__0, In this paper, we define a new family of curves and call it a familyof similar curves with variable transformation or briefly SA-curves. Also weintroduce some characterizations of this family and we give some theorems.This definition introduces a new classification of a space curve. Also, we usethis definition to deduce the position vectors of plane curves, general helicesand slant helices, as examples of a similar curves with variable transformation
__label__0, We investigate the use of a novel multi-lens imaging system in the context of biometric identification, and more specifically, for iris recognition. Multi-lenslet cameras offer a number of significant advantages over standard single-lens camera systems, including thin form-factor and wide angle of view. By using appropriate lenslet spacing relative to the detector pixel pitch, the resulting ensemble of images implicitly contains subject information at higher spatial frequencies than those present in a single image. Additionally, a multi-lenslet approach enables the use of observational diversity, including phase, polarization, neutral density, and wavelength diversities. For example, post-processing multiple observations taken with differing neutral density filters yields an image having an extended dynamic range. Our research group has developed several multi-lens camera prototypes for the investigation of such diversities. In this paper, we present techniques for computing a high-resolution reconstructed image from an ensemble of low-resolution images containing sub-pixel level displacements. The quality of a reconstructed image is measured by computing the Hamming distance between the Daugman4 iris code of a conventional reference iris image, and the iris code of a corresponding reconstructed image. We present numerical results concerning the effect of noise and defocus blur in the reconstruction process using simulated data and report preliminary work on the reconstruction of actual iris data obtained with our camera prototypes.
__label__0, The study of stem cells is one of the most important biomedical research. Understanding their development could allow multiple applications in regenerative medicine. For this purpose, automated solutions for the observation of stem cell development process are needed. This study introduces an on-line analysis method for the modelling of neurosphere evolution during the early time of their development under phase contrast microscopy. From the corresponding phase contrast time-lapse sequences, we extract information from the neurosphere using a combination of phase contrast physics deconvolution and curve detection for locate the cells inside the neurosphere. Then, based on prior biological knowledge, we generate possible and optimal 3-dimensional configuration using 2D to 3D registration methods and evolutionary optimisation algorithm.
__label__0, This study aims to propose a simple calculation method considering road network factors and summarized into 6 indexes for evaluation. Shin-hua Township in Tainan County is selected for case study. Firstly, factor analysis is used for the key factors affecting shelter safety and cluster analysis is taken for attributes classification. Then the final results with quantified indexes are showed in GIS with an easy visual map for urban planning review.
__label__0, Practical difficulties associated with assessment of central parameters necessitates the development of peripheral markers of suicidal risk. Recent research suggest that serum lipid profile may be a useful indicator of suicidal behaviour. Serum lipid profiles of forty suicide attempters were compared with forty age, sex and BMI matched controls. Total serum cholesterol, serum Triglyceride, LDL levels and HDL levels were found to be lower in suicide attempters but were not statistically significant. Statistically significant negative con-elation was seen between risk-rescue score and above mentioned parameters. No statitically significant difference was observed when various diagnostic break-up groups of patients were compared.
__label__0, Wireless power transfer system with coil arrays which can supply to several apparatus at the same time is expected. In this case, only one or two primary coils under the secondary coil are excited. The electromotive force of the secondary coil is changed by the interval of primary coils and the number of the excited coils. In this paper, the effective equivalent circuit which could reproduce this behavior is presented.
__label__0, Cover song recognition, also called version identification, can only be solved by exposing the underlying tonal content of music. Apart from obvious applications in copyright enforcement, techniques for cover identification can also be used to find patterns and structure in music datasets too large for any musicologist to even listen to. Much progress has been made on cover song recognition, but work to date has been reported on datasets of at most a few thousand songs, using algorithms that simply do not scale beyond the capacity of a small portable music player. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding covers in a database of a million songs, and we only consider algorithms that can deal with such data. Using a fingerprinting-inspired model, we present the first results of cover song recognition on the Million Song Dataset. This task has been renewed by the availability of so many tracks, and this work is intended to be the first step towards a practical solution.
__label__0, The nursing profession has shown tremendous adaptability throughout the ages. Cancer nurses have encountered many challenges and changes during this past century that have marked our increasingly rapid progress on the long road of development of cancer nursing. The movement from an illness-focused, hospital-based, physician-dominated health care model to preventive, community-defined and collaborative health care is providing exciting new opportunities for nurses. Advances in science and technology and a more informed consumer present unique challenges as well. Based on the trends and the tremendous breakthroughs occurring during this decade, this article explores visions and dreams of the preferred future of cancer nursing as we march into the next millennium.
__label__0, A new configuration of dual mode combined dielectric and conductor loaded cavity filter is presented. Using one or two conductor loaded cavities with dielectric loaded cavities, both low loss and excellent spurious performance are achieved. Resonant frequencies, unloaded Q and the fields of both resonators are rigorously computed by mode matching method. The coupling between two resonators is computed by small aperture approximation theory. Three different types of 4-pole elliptic function filters under same condition are constructed. Insertion loss and spurious performance of the filters are compared. Experimental results verify the theory.
__label__0, In this paper we analyze a simple mathematical model which describes the interaction between proteins P53 and Mdm2. For the stationary state we discuss the local stability and the existence of a Hopf bifurcation. We study the direction and stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions by choosing the delay as a bifurcation parameter. Finally, we will offer some numerical simulations and present our conclusions.
__label__0, The flight control system is the most important system of a launch vehicle, so strict and comprehensive tests must be carried out on it. As for the control system of a new type of launch vehicle, it brings more signals and information than before. In order to ensure the reliability of data acquisition and real-time processing of testing information, a new method of concerted multi-card acquisition and testing Information processing is presented in this paper. In particular, a software based adjustable frequency sampling and storage method for analog signals is introduced in detail. Corresponding test system has been developed and applied to real launch task, and testing conflicts are avoided, testing flexibility is improved.
__label__0, Disasters, whether natural or man-made, compromise the quality of life for all involved. In such situations, expeditious recovery activities are deemed imperative and irreplaceable for the restoration of normalcy. However, recovery activities rely heavily on the critical infrastructures that supply basic needs like electricity, water, information, and transportation. When disasters strike, it is likely that the critical infrastructures themselves are affected significantly, hampering efficient recovery processes, thus presenting a Catch-22 conundrum. In this article, we present examples from different parts of the world where distributed energy resources, organized in a microgrid, were used to provide reliable electricity supply in the wake of disasters, allowing recovery and rebuilding efforts to occur with relatively greater efficiency.
__label__0, The interaction impedance of coupled cavity slow wave structures can be measured by perturbing the resonances of a shorted length of the structure using a dielectric rod. An analysis of this procedure is presented. The analysis retains radial as well as axial electric fields and all significant space harmonics. The results obtained are easily programmed formulas for calculating total interaction impedance or Pierce impedance using the experimental data.
__label__0, We consider some modifications of the neural gas algorithm. First, fuzzy assignments as known from fuzzy c-means and neighborhood cooperativeness as known from self-organizing maps and neural gas are combined to obtain a basic Fuzzy Neural Gas. Further, a kernel variant and a simulated annealing approach are derived. Finally, we introduce a fuzzy extension of the ConnIndex to obtain an evaluation measure for clusterings based on fuzzy vector quantization.
__label__0, Precise wiring of cortical circuits during development depends upon axon extension, guidance, and branching to appropriate targets. Motile growth cones at axon tips navigate through the nervous system by responding to molecular cues, which modulate signaling pathways within axonal growth cones. Intracellular calcium signaling has emerged as a major transducer of guidance cues but exactly how calcium signaling pathways modify the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton to evoke growth cone behaviors and axon branching is still mysterious. Axons must often pause their extension in tracts while their branches extend into targets. Some evidence suggests a competition between growth of axons and branches but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Since it is difficult to study growing axons deep within the mammalian brain, much of what we know about signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics of growth cones comes from tissue culture studies, in many cases, of non-mammalian species. Consequently it is not well understood how guidance cues relevant to mammalian neural development in vivo signal to the growth cone cytoskeleton during axon outgrowth and guidance. In this review we describe our recent work in dissociated cultures of developing rodent sensorimotor cortex in the context of the current literature on molecular guidance cues, calcium signaling pathways, and cytoskeletal dynamics that regulate growth cone behaviors. A major challenge is to relate findings in tissue culture to mechanisms of cortical development in vivo. Toward this goal, we describe our recent work in cortical slices, which preserve the complex cellular and molecular environment of the mammalian brain but allow direct visualization of growth cone behaviors and calcium signaling. Findings from this work suggest that mechanisms regulating axon growth and guidance in dissociated culture neurons also underlie development of cortical connectivity in vivo.
__label__0, Many tools for object-oriented software design focus on assisting individuals in creating UML models for documentation and implementation purposes. Since software design is a highly collaborative activity, one must ask whether the requirements for facilitating collaborative design are similar.We report on a study of design teams, focusing on their use of notations and artifacts. Our findings highlight the unique characteristic of the use of UML in these settings and emphasize the importance of context and relations between artifacts over the details of specific artifacts.
__label__0, We study the depinning transition of driven interfaces in thin ferromagnetic films driven by external magnetic fields. Approaching the transition point the correlation length increases with decreasing driving. If the correlation length becomes of the order of the film thickness a crossover to two-dimensional behavior occurs. From the corresponding scaling analysis, we determine the exponents characterizing the transition of the three-dimensional system.
__label__0, This paper explores the complications encountered when attempting to create a secure pervasive computing environment. The model introduced in this paper is primarily conceptual. The chosen environment is built around a shared space containing a classified network. Since access to the classified network is only available to people once they are in this space, we investigate what is required to ensure only authorised people can enter, which highlights problems inherent in any kind of physical access control, and then how to carry this through to manage their access to information once inside the space.A layered agent architecture is considered, using real time devices such as biometric mechanisms, door actuators and a smart card reader acting as the lower level agents. These agents are then wrapped in software allowing them to communicate with higher level agents that through the coordination of these low level agents control the security of the pervasive environment. Security is further enhanced, by preventing the classified network from communicating with the network containing the biometric devices and databases.We also consider the security implications of using paper documents within the shared space, as well as the possibility of any other devices that could potentially be used for smuggling information out of the environment.
__label__0, The cytoskeleton plays several fundamental roles in the cell, including organizing the spatial arrangement of subcellular organelles, regulating cell dynamics and motility, providing a platform for interaction with neighboring cells, and ultimately defining overall cell shape. Fluorescence imaging has proved to be vital in furthering our understanding of the cytoskeleton, and is now a mainstay technique used widely by cell biologists. In this review we provide an introduction to various imaging modalities used to study focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton, and using specific examples we highlight a number of recent studies in animal cells that have advanced our knowledge of cytoskeletal behavior.
__label__0, In this study, despite any negative results, the authors found that patient reunions can be structured in an appropriate way. The overall impact on both inpatients and returning former inpatients seemed to be helpful and to promote personal growth. The staff membems felt very positive about the reunions, and the reunions thus seemed to minimize staff burnout in an otherwise very stressful job. The possibility of patients' causing harm to each others' treatment programs exists, but it can be minimized to an extent by screening high-risk invitations and by close staff supervision of the reunion. We conclude that if the theoretical and logistical issues of holding reunions of former inpatients are dealt with in advance, the constructive potentialities outweigh the destructive elements. We feel that our experience is neither unique nor idiosyncratic and that much themapeutic benefit can result from such reunions. Further research will be needed to assess the overall impact of patient reunions and to evaluate ...
__label__0, In clinical practice, gastroenterologists commonly encounter patients with chronic symptoms that appear to arise from the proximal gastrointestinal tract; yet, after initial evaluation, the majority of these patients do not have peptic ulceration or any other structural or biochemical explanation for their symptoms. This article will critically review the diagnosis and management of patients who have dyspepsia of unknown cause.
__label__0, In this paper we discuss the problenl of ascribing beliefs to an agent, given partial knowledge of his beliefs. The particular kind of ascription we are interested in we call explanatory ascription, since it ascribes beliefs to an agent as a means of explaining the beliefs we already know he has. We explore two approaches to explanatory ascription. In the first, we develop a model of belief called the derivational model, in which the derivation of one belief fl'om another is made explicit. This model and its proof theory are formalized and used to solve a variation of the Wise Man Puzzle. For comparison, a second approach using a.n abductive framework and a standard modal logic of belief is developed. This approach leads to weaker conclusions than the derivational model, because closure conditions on derivations cannot be stated. On the other hand, the representational power-of the two approaches differs, the abductive system being more expressive with respect to disjunctive information about belief, and the derivationM model allowing nonmonotonic reasoning by the believer. The next section of the paper gives some background in the area of belief ascription. The third section describes the problem of explanatory ascription, and some general properties that a successful approach should have. The fourth and fifth sections develop the derivational model and its proof theory, while the sixth describes an abductive framework and compares it to the derivational approach. Finally, we discuss some extensions to the language of the derivational model.
__label__0, We show that for a particular class of quantum channels, which we call heralded channels, monogamy of squashed entanglement limits the superadditivity of Holevo capacity. Heralded channels provide a means to understand the quantum erasure channel composed with an arbitrary other quantum channel, as well as common situations in experimental quantum information that involve frequent loss of qubits or failure of trials. We also show how entanglement monogamy applies to non-classicality in quantum games, and we consider how any faithful, monogamous entanglement measure may bound the achievable value of entanglement-dependent quantities in many-party scenarios.
__label__0, The present review offers a survey of liquid electrolytes used in dye-sensitized solar cells from the beginning of photoelectrochemical cell research. It handles both the solvents employed, and the prerequisites identified for an ideal liquid solvent, as well as the various effects of electrolyte solutes in terms of redox systems and additives. The conclusions of the present review call for more detailed molecular insight into the electrolyte-electrode interface reactions and structures.
__label__0, Shape serves as an important additional feature for space target classification, which is complementary to those made available. Since different shapes lead to different projection functions, the projection property can be regarded as one kind of shape feature. In this work, the problem of estimating the projection function from the infrared signature of the object is addressed. We show that the projection function of any rotationally symmetric object can be approximately represented as a linear combination of some base functions. Based on this fact, the signal model of the emissivity-area product sequence is constructed, which is a particular mathematical function of the linear coefficients and micro-motion parameters. Then, the least square estimator is proposed to estimate the projection function and micro-motion parameters jointly. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
__label__0, This paper describes two new algorithms for solving inclusion based points-to analysis. The first algorithm, the Wave Propagation Method, is a modified version of an early technique presented by Pearce et al; however, it greatly improves on the running time of its predecessor. The second algorithm, the Deep Propagation Method, is a more light-weighted analysis, that requires less memory. We have compared these algorithms with three state-of-the-art techniques by Hardekopf-Lin, Heintze-Tardieu and Pearce-Kelly-Hankin. Our experiments show that Deep Propagation has the best average execution time across a suite of 17 well-known benchmarks, the lowest memory requirements in absolute numbers, and the fastest absolute times for benchmarks under 100,000 lines of code. The memory-hungry Wave Propagation has the fastest absolute running times in a memory rich execution environment, matching the speed of the best known points-to analysis algorithms in large benchmarks.

__label__0, This paper discusses and analyses the tradeoff between the flexibility afforded with greater number of staff and the implied cost of employing extra staff in the context of the nurse-scheduling problem. If the number of staff is constant, our study allows quantification of the degree of pressure put on the staff resulting from the schedules that do not satisfy their preferences for shift allocation. We present a practical approach, based on our domain transformation methodology that achieves good quality schedules without high computational requirements.
__label__0, The Delphi technique for judgmental forecasting by expert gr- oups is described and the controversy surrounding its use is summarized. The technique clearly does not eliminate all unwanted psychological effects on group judgment. F'urthermore, the design of most Delphi studies makes it impossible to separate the signal from the noise in expert judgment. A methodological standard for evaluating judgmental forecasts is proposed.
__label__0, Broad band J, H and K 0 and spectral Br 2.166 m images have been obtained in four areas surrounding regions of thermal radio emission. Localized variations in the extinction are examined by means of color and comparison of the observed Br ux with the Br emission predicted from radio continuum data. Results show few spatial variations and little correlation with the position of the radio emission features.
__label__0, Experimentation in software engineering is necessary but difficult. One reason is that there are a large number of context variables and, so, creating a cohesive understanding of experimental results requires a mechanism for motivating studies and integrating results. It requires a community of researchers that can replicate studies, vary context variables, and build models that represent the common observations about the discipline. The paper discusses the experience of the authors, based upon a collection of experiments, in terms of a framework for organizing sets of related studies. With such a framework, experiments can be viewed as part of common families of studies, rather than being isolated events. Common families of studies can contribute to important and relevant hypotheses that may not be suggested by individual experiments. A framework also facilitates building knowledge in an incremental manner through the replication of experiments within families of studies. To support the framework, the paper discusses the experiences of the authors in carrying out empirical studies, with specific emphasis on persistent problems encountered in experimental design, threats to validity, criteria for evaluation, and execution of experiments in the domain of software engineering.
__label__0, We show that the Grothendieck-Witt and Witt groups of smooth complex cellular varieties can be identified with their topo- logical KO-groups. As an application, we deduce the values of the Witt groups of all irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces, including smooth complex quadrics, spinor varieties and symplectic Grassman- nians.
__label__0, The characteristic equation of a discrete time-delayed continuous system contains the terms of an exponential function with respect to eigenvalues, i.e. the characteristic equation is a transcendental equation. That makes it hard to obtain the conditions for Hopf bifurcation to occur. A system for controlling a neural equation with discrete time delay based on the washout filter is presented. The transcendental equation of the corresponding linearized system is analyzed in detail. In this control system, it is found that a chaotic orbit can be controlled to a periodic solution; Hopf bifurcation occurs when control parameters are properly chosen. Some numerical results are also presented to illustrate the correctness of our results.
__label__0, We develop a consistent mutable replication extension for NFSv4 tuned to meet the rigorous demands of large-scale data sharing in global collaborations. The system uses a hierarchical replication control protocol that dynamically elects a primary server at various granularities. Experimental evaluation indicates a substantial performance advantage over a single server system. With the introduction of the hierarchical replication control, the overhead of replication is negligible even when applications mostly write and replication servers are widely distributed.
__label__0, For conventional motor soft starter, the starting torque would be seriously decreased when reduce the starting voltage, so it is limited to light load, However, many overloading start-up is required in practical applications. According to the relationship between three-phase asynchronous motor electromagnetic torque and power frequency, when keeping the size of voltage unchanged, the torque can be increased by reducing the power frequency. Keeping the main circuit of original motor soft starting system unchanged, the motor rotation is controlled by changing the thyristor trigger angle, converting the frequency which add up in the stator and utilizing the fundamental components. This paper presents a method of improving starting torque based on discrete variable frequency and the three-phase asynchronous motor soft starter model is established using MATLAB. The simulation results illustrate discrete variable frequency softer starter has many advantages in current, speed and torque compared to full-voltage starter and current limit starter.

Some practical cases are outlined.
__label__0, Summary form only given. We measure the line-width enhancement factor of quantum dot semiconductor lasers and analyse its impact on the sensitivity to optical feedback. In particular, we show that the line-width enhancement factor can be relatively large due to both inhomogeneous broadening but also due to the plasma effects from non-resonant carriers. However, the devices have a low sensitivity to optical feedback mainly due to the strong damping of the relaxation oscillations that can be associated with gain saturation.
__label__0, Previous mathematical descriptions of sampling using passive monitors have used Fick's First Law of diffusion and the assumption that the concentration of adsorbate in the vapor phase above the sorbent is zero. This paper shows that by introducing a simplified expression for the equilibrium vapor pressure, behavior more nearly resembling that observed for passive monitors is predicted. The theory can also be applied to the case of loss of sample from a diffusive monitor. Experimental evidence is also provided which demonstrates that the theory adequately describes the observed results.

__label__0, A variance-covariance model is suggested for plotting the distribution of a quantitative trait analyzed in animal pedigrees resulting from crosses of outbred lines. The model takes inbreeding into account. A special parameter characterizing the degree of inbreeding has been introduced, which makes the model versatile. Pedigrees with the same structure that contain or not contain inbred individuals have been compared to analyze the effect of inbreeding on the parameters of the trait distribution, such as the mean genotypic value and variance of the trait.
__label__0, We realize a one-dimensional Josephson junction using quantum degenerate Bose gases in a tunable double well potential on an atom chip. Matter wave interferometry gives direct access to the relative phase field, which reflects the interplay of thermally driven fluctuations and phase locking due to tunneling. The thermal equilibrium state is characterized by probing the full statistical distribution function of the two-point phase correlation. Comparison to a stochastic model allows us to measure the coupling strength and temperature and hence a full characterization of the system.
__label__0, Refuse collection has been the main public service to be out-sourced in Denmark since the EU guidelines on public procurement came into force in 1993. The contracting activities of the municipalities are framed by a complex set of ideologies and objectives, in addition to regulations. At both EU level and at national level, the demands for marketization of the public sector are counterbalanced by demands for social and environmental considerations. The procurement directive reflects the balance legalizing the inclusion of such requirements by contracting. The Danish experiences, however, tell a grim tale of subordination of social requirements in municipal contracting practices with implications for the quality of the service. The results of a recent study of developments in the working conditions at commercial collection companies show deterioration in respect of health and safety, competence building and job security concurrent with the increase in outsourcing and competition in the sector. In the analysis of the results, a combination of municipal cost-saving strategies, harsh market forces and cultural influences are identified as causal factors. Drawing on a brief institutional analysis, it is concluded that the existing normative and regulative framework of municipal contracting needs reinforcement if societal intentions of qualified public services and acceptable working conditions are to be effective. Initiatives to simultaneously improve working conditions and environmental results of collection are called for.
__label__0, The authors present long-term results of using costal and alar allo-cartilages for repairing defects of the cartilage part of nasal ridge. Transplantation of the costal allo-cartilage to 362 patients entailed cartilage deformations in 50, inflammation in 34 and resolution of the cartilage in 26 patients. Transplantation of alar cartilage brought resolution and deformation in 10 and 7 cases of 276 transplantations, respectively, in the absence of inflammation. Moreover, the latter material provides better cosmetic results.
__label__0, A new type of thesaurus for word processing is proposed. It comprises 7 semantic and 8 syntagmatic types of links between Russian words and collocations. The original version now includes ca. 76,000 basic dictionary entries, 660,000 semantic and 292,000 syntagmatic links, English interface, and communication with any text editor. Methods of delivery enriching are used based on generic and synonymous links.
__label__0, Selection of reliable cancer biomarkers is crucial for gene expression profile-based precise diagnosis of cancer type and successful treatment. However, current studies are confronted with overfitting and dimensionality curse in tumor classification and false positives in the identification of cancer biomarkers. Here, we developed a novel gene-ranking method based on neighborhood rough set reduction for molecular cancer classification based on gene expression profile. Comparison with other methods such as PAM, ClaNC, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and Relief-F, our method shows that only few top-ranked genes could achieve higher tumor classification accuracy. Moreover, although the selected genes are not typical of known oncogenes, they are found to play a crucial role in the occurrence of tumor through searching the scientific literature and analyzing protein interaction partners, which may be used as candidate cancer biomarkers.
__label__0, Titanium implants with immobilized lincomycin and ampicillin were studied on rats with respect to the effect on development of inflammatory reactions. The data on the concentrations of sialic acids in the blood during the postoperative period and the histological examinations showed that lower concentrations of sialic acids, early fibroblastic reaction, productive nature of inflammation in the main and rapid formation of the fibrous connective tissue capsule around the implants were the characteristic features and advantages of the use of the implants with the immobilized antibiotics as compared to the use of the routine titanium implants.
__label__0, Due to the complexity and variability of capital construction sites, real-time monitoring remains an elusive goal. As unit price continues to fall, camera networks are becoming increasingly viable sensing modalities. The benefits of combining multiple, overlapping image sources include the ability to produce 3D scene reconstruction as well as localize and track objects. In the construction domain, these benefits enhance situation awareness by facilitating tracking of construction equipment and material, generating progress reports, and providing automated alerts in the event of a safety hazard. In this paper we describe the use of a camera network with a discussion of practical considerations in calibration and tracking. We conclude with a demonstration of a usage example.

__label__0, In global software projects, informal communication across sites is severely hampered, making it difficult to disseminate implicit knowledge. Participants have a partial view of the overall organization, do not have access to the complete rationale behind decisions, and when changes arise, participants from other sites are surprised. Consequently, issues that could be clarified almost immediately require days until the relevant stakeholders are identified, the issues are understood, and a resolution is agreed upon. We focus on the specific problem of externalizing issues with their context, stakeholders, and organizational roles in distributed settings. The challenge is to capture sufficient knowledge as a side effect of development, while structuring it for long-term use. We describe Sysiphus, a distributed environment providing a uniform framework for system models, collaboration artifacts, and organizational models. Sysiphus encourages participants to make communication and issues explicit in the context of system models and become aware of relevant stakeholders
__label__0, ABSTRACT Whether Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus can be recovered after passage through the human gut was tested by feeding 20 healthy volunteers commercial yogurt. Yogurt bacteria were found in human feces, suggesting that they can survive transit in the gastrointestinal tract.
__label__0, The role of the veterinary forensic pathologist in the investigation of animal abuse or neglect can go beyond documenting the condition of animals presented as evidence. Although animal cruelty is a moral concern and a crime in itself, law enforcement response to such crimes is often enhanced by the recognition that crimes against animals can be both indicators of other ongoing crimes against people and predictors of the potential for interpersonal violence. An understanding of common motives underlying animal cruelty can aid the pathologist in asking appropriate questions. The authors review the forms of pathology evidence commonly seen in various presentations of animal cruelty. Understanding these forms of evidence can help the pathologist describe findings that can be significant for assessing the potential risks the alleged perpetrator may pose to other animals and humans.
__label__0, A new methodology is presented that describes the density of urban systems. By combining highly detailed height measurements with amongst others topographical data we are able to quantify the urban volume. This new approach is tested in two separate case-studies that respectively relate to the temporal and spatial dimension of the urban environment. In the first study the growth of the city of Amsterdam over the past century is studied. The urban volume indicator is used to visualise and quantify the urban extension and intensification process. To critically analyse the spatio-temporal development of Amsterdam the self-organizing map approach is applied. Special attention is given to highlighting any signs of recent polynuclear development. The second case-study compares the spatial distribution of high-density zones of the four major Dutch cities

__label__0, In recent years, cognitive and educational psychologists have become interested in applying principles of cognitive psychology to education. Here, we discuss the importance of understanding the nature and occurrence of mind wandering in the context of classroom and online lectures. In reviewing the relevant literature, we begin by considering early studies that provide important clues about student attentiveness via dependent measures such as physical markers of inattention, note taking, and retention. We then provide a broad overview of studies that have directly measured mind wandering in the classroom and online learning environments. Finally, we conclude by discussing interventions that might be effective at curbing the occurrence of mind wandering in educational settings, and consider various avenues of future research that we believe can shed light on this well-known but little studied phenomenon.
__label__0, By means of molecular biology and serology, we detect the infective state of cytomegalovirus in 58 patients with infective disease of respiratory tract. The result shows that the infective state of cytomegalovirus exists in the RTID, but there is no virusemia in patients. The immune response of past-infection of cytomegalovirus in the patients of RTID is rather remarkable.
__label__0, The scenario of this work is defined by the need of many Machine Learning algorithms to tune a number of parameters that define its behavior; the resulting performance can be evaluated with different indices. The relationship between parameters and performance may be neither linear nor straightforward. This work proposes a qualitative ap- proach to the afore-mentioned relationship by using Self-Organizing Maps due to their visual information processing. The approach is evaluated in the framework of Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
__label__0, Relational databases provide significant flexibility to organize, store, and manipulate an infinite variety of complex data collections. This flexibility is enabled by the concept of relational data schemas, which allow data owners to easily design custom databases according to their unique needs. However, user interfaces and information visualizations for accessing and utilizing databases have not kept pace with this level of flexibility. This paper introduces the concept of visualization schemas, based on the Snap-Together Visualization model, which are analogous to relational data schemas. Visualization schemas enable users to rapidly construct customized multiple-view visualizations for databases in a similarly flexible fashion without programming. Since the design of appropriate visualizations for a given database depends on the data schema, visualization schemas are a natural analogy to the data schema concept.
__label__0, In an event of failure, network survivability performance could be demonstrated through restoration. Link restoration is the simplest restoration technique provided by determining paths around a failed link. Our aim is to represent the load distribution level with appropriate values. Therefore, we propose a novel performance index scheme for evaluating how well the restoration scheme can distribute the disrupted traffic among restoration paths. A modified restoration scheme is proposed in order to consider load distribution in path computation by using link restoration technique. Experimental results show that our proposed index forms a good representation of survivability value. By using our proposed restoration scheme, the network load distribution is improved, compared with the shortest path scheme. The outcome of the restoration ratio are also improved equally well when traffic demands are increased or spare capacities is insufficient
__label__0, The necessary conditions for the diagnosability of control systems with a complex structure are given. It is shown that the topological conditions for detectability and localization of the fault signal do not depend on the class of operators of the dynamic model of the control system and are checked by using path search algorithms in directed graphs.

__label__0, In the past few decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has rapidly increased worldwide. Thyroid cancer incidence is relatively high in regions where the population's daily iodine intake is insufficient. While low dietary iodine has been considered as a risk factor for thyroid cancer development, previous studies found controversial results across different food types. Among different ethnic groups, dietary factors are influenced by various dietary patterns, eating habits, life-styles, nutrition, and other environmental factors. This review reports the association between dietary factors and thyroid cancer risk among ethnic groups living in different geologic regions. Iodine-rich food such as fish and shellfish may provide a protective role in populations with insufficient daily iodine intake. The consumption of goitrogenic food, such as cruciferous vegetables, showed a positive association with risk. While considered to be a risk factor for other cancers, alcohol intake showed a protective role against thyroid cancer. High consumption of meat such as chicken, pork, and poultry showed a positive association with the risk, but dairy products showed no significant association. Regular use of multivitamins and dietary nitrate and nitrite also showed a positive association with thyroid cancer risk. However, the study results are inconsistent and investigations into the mechanism for how dietary factors change thyroid hormone levels and influence thyroid function are required.
__label__0, The amino acid sequences of two ferredoxins isolated from pokeweed, Phytolacca americana, were determined. Tryptic peptides of maleyl-carboxymethyl-ferredoxin I and carboxymethyl-ferredoxin II were prepared and analyzed. The large peptides were further digested with staphylococcal protease and chymotrypsin. Ferredoxins I and II were composed of 96 and 98 amino acid residues, respectively. Though ferredoxin I lacks tryptophan and methionine, ferredoxin II contains both of them. In a comparison of the amino acid sequences with those of other higher plant ferredoxins, ferredoxin I is one residue shorter than others at the carboxyl-terminus and ferredoxin II one longer than others at the amino-terminus. Ferredoxins I and II differ in 23 sites from each other and in 27 to 37 sites from other higher plant ferredoxins. This suggests that duplication of the ferredoxin gene occurred after the divergence of pokeweed from other higher plants. A phylogenetic tree including all other ferredoxins was constructed.
__label__0, Preoperative cardiac risk assessment for noncardiac thoracic surgery is limited by the lack of data specific to this type of surgery, especially prospective, controlled data. However, the value of clinical predictors in determining accurate postoperative cardiac outcomes is a reliable tool. Thus, the approach is similar to traditional cardiac risk assessment for noncardiac surgery. The essential elements of cardiovascular evaluation as it pertains to noncardiac thoracic surgery are reviewed with a specific focus on coronary artery disease, perioperative arrhythmias, and selected topics relevant to noncardiac thoracic surgery. The core recommendations of the clinical guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association are discussed in the context of noncardiac thoracic surgery.

__label__0, The usability of APIs is increasingly important to programmer productivity. Based on experience with usability studies of specific APIs, techniques were explored for studying the usability of design choices common to many APIs. A comparative study was performed to assess how professional programmers use APIs with required parameters in objects' constructors as opposed to parameterless "default" constructors. It was hypothesized that required parameters would create more usable and self- documenting APIs by guiding programmers toward the correct use of objects and preventing errors. However, in the study, it was found that, contrary to expectations, programmers strongly preferred and were more effective with APIs that did not require constructor parameters. Participants' behavior was analyzed using the cognitive dimensions framework, and revealing that required constructor parameters interfere with common learning strategies, causing undesirable premature commitment.
__label__0, We investigate the homogenization limit of a free boundary problem with space-dependent free boundary velocities. The problem under consideration has a well-known obstacle problem transformation, formally obtained by integrating with respect to the time variable. By making rigorous the link between these two problems, we are able to derive an explicit formula for the homogenized free boundary velocity, and we establish the uniform convergence of the free boundaries.

__label__0, We study general state-space Markov chains that depend on a parameter, say, . Sufficient conditions are established for the stationary performance of such a Markov chain to be differentiable with respect to . Specifically, we study the case of unbounded performance functions and thereby extend the result on weak differentiability of stationary distributions of Markov chains to unbounded mappings. First, a closed-form formula for the derivative of the stationary performance of a general state-space Markov chain is given using an operator-theoretic approach. In a second step, we translate the derivative formula into unbiased gradient estimators. Specifically, we establish phantom-type estimators and score function estimators. We illustrate our results with examples from queueing theory.
__label__0, Propagating illofemoral venous thrombosis that occurs despite adequate anticoagulation can be detected by the serial fibrinogen uptake test. Twenty-three patients who were receiving heparin sodium for confirmed iliofemoral thrombophlebitis underwent the serial fibrinogen uptake test. There was an increasing percentage of isotope uptake at the groin and the upper part of the thigh in eight of these patients, three of whom subsequently developed clinical signs, perfusion, and ventiliation lung scan findings compatible with the occurrence of pulmonary embolism. The remaining 15 patients had decreasing serial fibrinogen uptake during heparin therapy and no sequelas indicative of pulmonary embolism. Progressive thrombosis in adequately heparinized patients indicates failure of anticoagulation therapy and, when this occurs, we believe that interior vena cava interruption should be considered before a first, but potentially lethal, pulmonary embolus develops.
__label__0, We recently introduced the concept of aqueous nanodomains to explain high potentization in homeopathy. These long-lived nanodomains carry excited states of at least two ranges of energy packets; one for chemical change, the other for target-information. Here we discuss how these nanodomains interact with their targets. Our assumption is that these targets are similar to nanodomains, thereby enhancing their interaction. We use a simple system involving only one enzyme reaction to model the normal, the diseased and the enhanced recovery phases. For the healthy phase, a range of initial enzyme concentrations lead to a stationary state. We adjust the initial enzyme concentration to find an 'ideal' value, for which at stationary state the enzyme cycle provides the identical substrate concentration for each of the adjoining components. We simulate the diseased phase by starting a fast isomerization between the free active enzyme and its inactive form. At the end of this phase another stationary state is reached. In the subsequent recovery phase the fast movement of the excited states in the homeopathic solution rapidly converts the inactive form of the enzyme to its electronically excited state, which then converts to active free enzyme. At the end of this phase we return to the stationary state reached at the end of the healthy phase, that is, complete recovery to health. This simple model omits many of the complexities of a live organism. However, the elements of homeopathic action at the target can be observed clearly, as shown by a number of simulations.
__label__0, The "community effect" is necessary for tissue differentiation. In the Xenopus muscle paradigm, e-FGF has been identified as a candidate community factor. Standley et al.1 now show that the community effect, mediated through FGF signalling, continues to be important at later stages of development in the posterior part of the embryo. In this region, the paraxial mesoderm is still undergoing segmentation into somites, which are the site of early skeletal muscle formation. Indeed, somitogenesis, together with the read-out of the Hox code, which confers anteroposterior positional identity, is regulated by FGF signalling. This raises the question of the co-ordination between these events and the community effect which orchestrates myogenesis.
__label__0, Hazard analysis plays an important role in the development of safety-critical systems. Hazard analysis techniques have been used in the development of automotive systems become more sophisticated in functionality, design, and applied technology, the need for a more comprehensive hazard analysis approach has arisen. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive hazard analysis approach for system safety programs. This comprehensive approach involves applying a number of hazard analysis techniques and then integrating their results. This comprehensive approach attempts to overcome the narrower scope of individual techniques while obtaining the benefits of all of them.

At least one series of identical segments are mounted on a rigid support to form a large primary reflector with each segment forming a part of the total profile. Each segment includes an accurately profiled reflective metal layer bonded to a concave surface of a substrate by an adhesive layer. The layer is formed on the appropriate substrate surface by transfer replication.
__label__0, The frequent ups and downs are characteristic to the stock market. The conventional standard models that assume that investors act rationally have not been able to capture the irregularities in the stock market patterns for years. As a result, behavioural finance is embraced to attempt to correct these model shortcomings by adding some factors to capture sentimental contagion which may be at play in determining the stock market. This paper assesses the predictive influence of sentiment on the stock market returns by using a non-parametric nonlinear approach that corrects specific limitations encountered in previous related work. In addition, the paper proposes a new approach to developing stock market volatility predictive models by incorporating a hybrid GARCH and artificial neural network framework, and proves the advantage of this framework over a GARCH only based framework. Our results reveal also that past volatility and positive sentiment appear to have strong predictive power over future volatility.
__label__0, This paper presents a graph-coloring-based algorithm for the exam scheduling application, with the objective of achieving fairness, accuracy, and optimal exam time period. Through the work, we consider few assumptions and constraints, closely related to the general exam scheduling problem, and mainly driven from accumulated experience at various universities. The performance of the algorithm is also a major concern of this paper.
__label__0, The nature of developmental buffering processes has been debated extensively, based on both theoretical reasoning and empirical studies. In particular, controversy has focused on the question of whether distinct processes are responsible for canalization, the buffering against environmental or genetic variation, and for developmental stability, the buffering against random variation intrinsic in developmental processes. Here, we address this question for the size and shape of Drosophila melanogaster wings in an experimental design with extensively replicated and fully controlled genotypes. The amounts of variation among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry differ markedly among genotypes, demonstrating a clear genetic basis for size and shape variability. For wing shape, there is a high correlation between the amounts of variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, which indicates a correspondence between the two types of buffering. Likewise, the multivariate patterns of shape variation among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry show a close association. For wing size, however, the amounts of individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry are not correlated. There was a significant link between the amounts of variation between wing size and shape, more so for fluctuating asymmetry than for variation among individuals. Overall, these experiments indicate a considerable degree of shared control of individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry, although it appears to differ between traits.
__label__0, The flexible job shop scheduling problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposes an improved shuffled frog-leaping algorithm to solve the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The algorithm possesses an adjustment sequence to design the strategy of local searching and an extremal optimization in information exchange. The computational result shows that the proposed algorithm has a powerful search capability in solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem compared with other heuristic algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm, tabu search and ant colony optimization. Moreover, the results also show that the improved strategies could improve the performance of the algorithm effectively.
__label__0, Many fields of study produce time series datasets, and both the size and number of theses datasets are increasing rapidly due to the improvement of data accumulation methods such as small, cheap sensors and routine logging of events. Humans often fail to comprehend the structure of a long time series dataset because of the overwhelming amount of data and the range of different time scales at which there may be meaningful patterns. BinX is an interactive tool that provides dynamic visualization and manipulation of long time series datasets. The dataset is visualized through user controlled aggregation, augmented by various information visualization techniques.

__label__0, Purpose of reviewCoronary artery damage resulting from Kawasaki's disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed world. This review highlights advances in our understanding of the etiology of Kawasaki's disease, the immune response leading to vascular damage, potential biomarkers, and insights into mechanisms of disease addressed by an animal model. Clinical dilemmas are discussed in the context of the new American Heart Association recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki's disease. Recent findingsImproved understanding of the mechanisms of disease will assist in identifying predisposed individuals and in development of more effective therapy. Most investigators agree that an infectious trigger leads to massive activation of the immune system, resulting in a prolonged self-directed immune response at the coronary arteries. The etiology debate has centered on the nature of and mechanisms involved in immune activation. Genetic studies have not provided conclusive answers to these questions. Mechanistic studies done in animal models have pointed to specific biologic factors critical for coronary artery damage and together with studies in children may lead to more rationally conceived biologically based interventions. Increasingly, the questions regarding clinical management address timing of therapy and the management of children presenting with atypical Kawasaki's disease. New guidelines and management algorithms have been proposed by the American Heart Association to address these concerns. SummaryBiochemical and phenotypic characterization of Kawasaki's disease continues to improve. Answers are closer on etiology, reliable biomarkers, valid predictors of coronary outcome, and improved treatment of this syndrome.
__label__0, In concerned with the high dimensions time series, which have the characteristic of multivariable, time-varying and time-lagging, were collected from multi-stage industrial processes, a method which is used to synchronize high-dimensions time series with temporal and spatial conversion is introduced in this paper. The high-dimensions time series is synchronized in spatial sampling by the conversion method. After the discretization for high-dimensions time series which is preprocessed by synchronization, first the control state is classified into normal state and high risk state by a simple association analysis; then using the method of state transition chain analysis, we successfully find the transition condition when the control system transform normal state into high risk state. This condition can be applied to reduce the quality defects of product and be used to guide the control strategy design of control system.
__label__0, Software debugging is time-consuming and effort-consuming. Although software debugging, especially fault-localization, has been studied for long, few practical debugging tools have been developed and used by the industry. In this paper we present VIDA, a visual interactive debugging tool, which has been integrated with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment to support a programmer's debugging process. During the programmer's conventional debugging process, VIDA continuously recommends break-points for the programmer based on the analysis of execution information and the gathered feedback from the programmer. Moreover, VIDA provides a program outline to help the programmer choose breakpoints and visualizes the static dependency relation to help the programmer make estimation at breakpoints.
__label__0, Abstract The recent finding that Broca's area, the motor center for speech, is activated during action observation lends support to the idea that human language may have evolved from neural substrates already involved in gesture recognition. Although fascinating, this hypothesis can be questioned because while observing actions of others we may evoke some internal, verbal description of the observed scene. Here we present fMRI evidence that the involvement of Broca's area during action observation is genuine. Observation of meaningful hand shadows resembling moving animals induces a bilateral activation of frontal language areas. This activation survives the subtraction of activation by semantically equivalent stimuli, as well as by meaningless hand movements. Our results demonstrate that Broca's area plays a role in interpreting actions of others. It might act as a motor-assembly system, which links and interprets motor sequences for both speech and hand gestures.
__label__0, Twenty-seven patients with unilateral sixth nerve palsy and ten normal subjects were studied. The range of ductions was examined and the degree of abduction defect was recorded. The amount of horizontal and vertical deviations was measured in nine diagnostic positions by the prism and cover test, Maddox rod and prism test, and magnetic scleral search coils. MRI with enhancement was performed for patients under 50 years of age and those with neurologic signs. CT with contrast was obtained in patients with ischemic risk factors and those over 50 years of age. If CT was normal, patients were followed at about 3 months. Those without improvement at 3 months and those with an abnormal CT were further investigated with MRI. We report here the primary deviations in our subjects; the results for secondary deviations were similar. ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
__label__0, The generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model and its inverse have been recently used in different micro-positioning applications to model and to compensate for the symmetric and asymmetric hysteresis loops. The Preisach model is one the most popular hysteresis models that used to characterize hysteresis in different materials and smart actuators. The inverse Preisach model has been used to compensate for the hysteresis nonlinearities in different micro-positioning applications. In this study, we use the inverse generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model which is exact and can be obtained analytically to compensate for Preisach hysteresis nonlinearity. We approximate general Preisach densities by the ones corresponding to the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, and show that the resulting compensation error is an L-bounded signal.
__label__0, Purpose of review To summarize the literature regarding appropriate endoscopic sampling and surveillance protocols for common inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract. Gastroenterologists increasingly use endoscopy with mucosal biopsy to detect inflammatory diseases, assess response to therapy, and monitor for progression to dysplasia. Recent findings Many diseases show a patchy distribution in the digestive tract and there may be poor correlation between the endoscopic appearance and presence of histologic abnormalities. Indeed, a clinician's ability to render a diagnosis is limited by endoscopic mucosal sampling. The appropriate number of tissue samples and required biopsy sites are not established for many gastrointestinal disorders, and adherence to guidelines may not yield a reliable diagnosis in all cases. Summary We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations and emerging endoscopic techniques for the evaluation of eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, chronic gastritis, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
__label__0, aeroelastic stability of a typical aerofoil section with two degrees of freedom induced by the unsteady aerodynamic loads. A method is presented to model the unsteady lift and pitching moment acting on a two-dimensional typical aerofoil section, operating under attached flow conditions in an incompressible flow. Starting from suitable generalisations and approximations to aerodynamic indicial functions, the unsteady loads due to an arbitrary forcing are represented in a state-space form. From the resulting equations of motion, the flutter speed is computed through stability analysis of a linear state-space system.
__label__0, Topical corticosteroids are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the ambulatory setting.1 They are the cornerstones of therapy for a wide variety of dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and intertrigo.2'3 In addition, they may also serve as adjuvant or alternative therapy for various other inflammatory, hyperproliferative and pruritic conditions. It is thought that the clinical effects of topical corticosteroids are mediated by their antiinflammatory, vasoconstrictive, anti-proliferative, and immunosuppressive properties.

Voltage Collapse point is also determined from the P-V and Q-V curves of the weakest and next weakest bus. The way of finding out Voltage Stability Margin is also proposed. Finally, a method to compensate the reactive power of the weakest bus to improve its stability is also proposed. Contingency test is also carried out to study at which condition the system is more secured. These techniques are tested on the IEEE-14 bus system and results are given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
__label__0, Probiotic microflora display numerous health benefits beyond providing basic nutritional value. They cooperatively maintain a delicate balance between the gastrointestinal tract and immune system. When this balance is disrupted, disease and inflammation result. Inflammation and over stimulation of the immune system by pathogenic bacteria are competitively inhibited by mucosal adherence of normal beneficial microflora. A healthy gastrointestinal tract with adequate mucus production and appropriate bacterial colonization prevents the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, modulates disease processes, and prevents widespread inflammatory disorders. The understanding of the function of probiotics in the maintenance of health and their importance in preventing disease serves to enhance the overall health of patients. With increasing understanding that beneficial microbes are required for health maintenance and disease prevention, probiotics may be commonly used as a therapeutic tool by health care practitioners in the not-too-distant future. This review presents a review of probiotics in health maintenance and disease prevention.
__label__0, A limited energy budget is a major obstacle to the practical, wide deployment of sensor networks and hence necessitates the judicious optimization of available resources. In this paper, joint optimization of sensing and communication resources to minimize total energy spent within a sensor network is considered. A particular sensor network model with one Gaussian source observed by many sensors, subject to additive independent Gaussian observation noise, is examined. Sensors communicate with the receiver over an additive Gaussian multiple access channel. The aim of the receiver is to reconstruct the underlying source with minimum mean squared error. The fundamental tradeoff between communication and sensing over this sensor network model is characterized. Under symmetric conditions, for a single sensor, power is shared equally between communication and sensing. As the number of sensors increases, the sensing error dominates the overall error expression, hence sensing takes almost all power. The optimal power scheduling among sensors in the asymmetric case is determined, and it is shown that the power allocation schedule admits a simple decentralized implementation. Numerical results show that joint optimization of communication and sensing power yields significant power savings compared to the conventional approach of optimization of only communication power allocation.
__label__0, Lidocaine CO2, used for anaesthesia in 26 gynaecological and urological patients, was injected into the epidural space at two temperatures -20 degrees C and 36 degrees C. We found that the higher temperature resulted in a faster onset of blockade, a longer duration of action, and a greater degree of motor blockade. We found, also, with the warmed solution a higher spread of analgesia, which could enable a reduction to be made in the volume necessary for satisfactory anaesthesia.

__label__0, The dance production process is strongly influenced within the physical rehearsal space by social context factors and dynamics, such as intimacy of bodies, gender distribution, and the hierarchy of choreographers and dancers. Introducing online tools for asynchronous collaboration can change the traditional dance production process and impact the social dynamics of the group. We developed and deployed the Choreographer's Notebook, a web-based, collaborative, multi-modal annotation tool used in the creative process of making dance. We collected usage logs and choreographer reflections on the use of this tool, along with conducting interviews and focus groups, from the interdisciplinary perspectives of both technologists and choreographers involved in the project. We describe the socio-technical impacts of the Choreographer's Notebook based on the results of its usage in three dance productions. We analyze these case studies through various contextual lenses and provide a visualization of how the choreographic correction process evolved.

It can be used in low power consumption equipment such as laptop computer and can improve the performance of battery and prolong the life of battery series.
__label__0, Curated databases of signal transduction have grown to describe several thousand reactions, and efficient use of these data requires the development of modelling tools to elucidate and explore system properties. We present PATHLOGIC-S, a Boolean specification for a signalling model, with its associated GPL-licensed implementation using integer programming techniques. The PATHLOGIC-S specification has been designed to function on current desktop workstations, and is capable of providing analyses on some of the largest currently available datasets through use of Boolean modelling techniques to generate predictions of stable and semi-stable network states from data in community file formats. PATHLOGIC-S also addresses major problems associated with the presence and modelling of inhibition in Boolean systems, and reduces logical incoherence due to common inhibitory mechanisms in signalling systems. We apply this approach to signal transduction networks including Reactome and two pathways from the Panther Pathways database, and present the results of computations on each along with a discussion of execution time. A software implementation of the framework and model is freely available under a GPL license.
__label__0, This paper discusses the evolution of UHF RFID tags towards Augmented Tags. Such an evolution must be compliant with the huge advantages that the tags encompass, in particular full passive feature, compact size, usage flexibility and cost effectiveness. The discussed evolutions are based on the exploitation of some of the properties of the tag antennas or the RFID chips. Indeed, it is well established that any modification introduced in the near field region of antenna will generate significant change in its parameters such as impedance and directivity. Therefore it could be used as an environment sensor. Besides, the non-linear behavior of RFID chip could be used to implement new functions such as energy harvesting and communication channel diversity. Moreover, the design of RFID chip can evolve to allow the integration of external sensor.

When the volume hologram is probed by out-of-plane probe beams, the diffraction images become curved lines.

__label__0, A patient became deeply comatose following a prolonged episode of cerebral hypoxia. Computed tomography performed within the first 24 hours showed marked hypodensity of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, and the caudate and lenticular nuclei. These findings paralleled the distribution of typical hypoxic changes noted at postmortem examination. Computed tomographic abnormalities such as these may prove useful in establishing an early diagnosis of profound cerebral hypoxia.

__label__0, The early patency of arteriovenous fistulas created for hemodialysis is affected by various factors, including venous stenosis. We conducted a study to investigate the effect of venous stenosis on early patency by examining perioperative arterial and venous pressures of the fistula. Among the 15 patients selected for the study, 11 had snuff-box fistulas, 3 Brescia-Cimino, and 1 brachial. A thrill was palpable over the anastomosis in 10 patients and absent in 5 patients. In terms of venous pressure, the patients with a thrill had a mean systolic pressure of 35.8 mm Hg and systolic-diastolic pressure gradient of 3.4 mm Hg. In the patients without a thrill, the values were 102.6 mm Hg and 42.8 mm Hg, respectively. In conclusion, patients with venous obstruction in the fistula had a much higher venous pressure than those with a patent fistula. If venous stenosis is suspected, measurement of fistula pressures may be useful for determining the early patency of arteriovenous fistulas.

Despite the availability of safe and efficacious immunization against the virus, only a small percent of persons at-risk for complications are immunized annually. This article describes influenza virus, indications for influenza vaccination, chemoprophylaxis and treatment of influenza, and strategies for practitioners to increase immunization rates among at-risk individuals.
__label__0, Regional innovation is more and more considered an important enabler of welfare. It is no coincidence that the European Commission has started looking at regional peculiarities and dynamics, in order to focus Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialization towards effective investment policies. In this context, this work aims to support policy makers in the analysis of innovation-relevant trends. We exploit a European database of the regional patent application to determine the dynamics of a set of technological innovation indicators. For this purpose, we design and develop a software system for assessing unfolding trends in such indicators. In contrast with conventional knowledge-based design, our approach is biologically-inspired and based on self-organization of information. This means that a functional structure, called track, appears and stays spontaneous at runtime when local dynamism in data occurs. A further prototyping of tracks allows a better distinction of the critical phenomena during unfolding events, with a better assessment of the progressing levels. The proposed mechanism works if structural parameters are correctly tuned for the given historical context. Determining such correct parameters is not a simple task since different indicators may have different dynamics. For this purpose, we adopt an adaptation mechanism based on differential evolution. The study includes the problem statement and its characterization in the literature, as well as the proposed solving approach, experimental setting and results.

A hypothetic scheme of the circadian organization of lymphocyte redistribution, proliferation and metabolism in mice is provided, interactions of circadian biorhythms and circadian fluctuations of functional activity of the immune system are demonstrated. It has been shown that circadian rhythms of the immunologic parameters are dependent on the regulative influence of hypophyseal hormones, glucocorticoids, and thymic endocrine factors. Interactions of the immune and endocrine systems in different phases of the circadian cycle have been specified.
__label__0, The threshold model is widely used to study the propagation of opinions and technologies in social networks. In this model individuals adopt the new behavior based on how many neighbors have already chosen it. We study cascades under the threshold model on sparse random graphs with community structure to see whether the existence of communities affects the number of individuals who finally adopt the new behavior. Specifically, we consider the permanent adoption model where nodes that have adopted the new behavior cannot change their state. When seeding a small number of agents with the new behavior, the community structure has little effect on the final proportion of people that adopt it, i.e., the contagion threshold is the same as if there were just one community. On the other hand, seeding a fraction of population with the new behavior has a significant impact on the cascade with the optimal seeding strategy depending on how strongly the communities are connected. In particular, when the communities are strongly connected, seeding in one community outperforms the symmetric seeding strategy that seeds equally in all communities.
__label__0, This is an interesting analysis of the characteristics of the dermatologist's practice, the diseases seen and the treatment used. The latter was the chief reason for this statistical study as measured in terms of the use of ionizing radiation. This is especially pertinent because of present-day concern regarding overexposure to such irradiation.
__label__0, In this paper we estimate the main parameters of some evaluation codes which are known as projective parameterized codes. We find the length of these codes and we give a formula for the dimension in terms of the Hilbert function associated to two ideals, one of them being the vanishing ideal of the projective torus. Also we find an upper bound for the minimum distance and, in some cases, we give some lower bounds for the regularity index and the minimum distance. These lower bounds work in several cases, particularly for any projective parameterized code associated to the incidence matrix of uniform clutters and then they work in the case of graphs.
__label__0, D-Xylonic acid belongs to the top 30 biomass-based platform chemicals and represents a promising application of xylose. Until today, Gluconobacter oxydans NL71 is the most efficient microbe capable of fermenting xylose into xylonate. However, its growth is seriously inhibited when concentrated lignocellulosic hydrolysates are used as substrates due to the presence of various degraded compounds formed during biomass pretreatment. Three critical lignocellulosic inhibitors were thereby identified, i.e., formic acid, furfural, and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. As microbe fermentation is mostly regulated at the genome level, four groups of cell transcriptomes were obtained for a comparative investigation by RNA sequencing of a control sample with samples treated separately with the above-mentioned inhibitors. The digital gene expression profiles screened 572, 714 genes, and 408 DEGs was obtained by the comparisons among four transcriptomes. A number of genes related to the different functional groups showed characteristic expression patterns induced by three inhibitors, in which 19 genes were further tested and confirmed by qRT-PCR. We extrapolated many differentially expressed genes that could explain the cellular responses to the inhibitory effects. We provide results that enable the scientific community to better define the molecular processes involved in the microbes' responses to lignocellulosic inhibitors during the cellular biooxidation of xylose into xylonic acid.
__label__0, During experimental studies with Q-switched laser radiation a laser beam with an impulse energy of 100 mJ reached the left eye of a patient. Dense vitreal hemorrhage developed; later fundus evaluation revealed coagulation of the macula with circular subretinal bleeding. Six month later a scar with retinal folds was observed at the posterior pole; the visual acuity was 0.1. The accident is compared with previously reported cases.
__label__0, One hundred twenty patients undergoing coronary artery surgery completed a randomized controlled study designed to investigate whether prophylactic chest physiotherapy affected the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Group 1 patients received no preoperative or postoperative chest physiotherapy. Group 2 patients received preoperative education and instruction in breathing and coughing exercises and postoperative supervision and assistance in performing the same. These exercises were supervised by a physiotherapist twice per day on the first 2 postoperative days and once per day on the 3rd and 4th postoperative days. Physiotherapy for group 3 patients was the same as for group 2 patients except that patients were seen by a physiotherapist 4 times per day on the first 2 postoperative days and twice per day on the 3rd and 4th postoperative days. Group 2 and 3 patients were instructed to practice breathing and coughing exercises every hour. Overall, an incidence of clinically significant postoperative pulmonary complications of 7.5 percent was demonstrated. In general, these patients demonstrated lower levels of preoperative pulmonary function and very low early postoperative oxygenation compared with those who did not develop pulmonary complications. There was no indication that the incidence or severity of fever, hypoxemia, chest roentgenologic abnormalities or clinically significant postoperative pulmonary complications was different between groups. These results suggest that the necessity for prophylactic chest physiotherapy after routine coronary artery surgery should be reviewed.

Among these are environmental changes, increasing globalization, industrialization of developing countries, and educational developments. The paper considers these issues, and in particular the 'bold transformation' of nurse education that will be necessary if the profession is to be able to deal with the future. The paper concludes with a series of recommended strategic changes.
__label__0, Increasing of demand in the energy sphere and also unprecedented proliferation of environmental pollutants in the air has pushed human toward the using of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic systems. Unfortunately, despite all the efforts made, in the field of photovoltaic systems, still the usability of this clean and renewable source is skeptical in the world. This paper examines some basic problems of photovoltaic systems and discusses a few new approaches to reduce some problems of photovoltaic systems. The proposed approaches have capabilities and difficulties which are investigated in this study.
__label__0, Hepatic portal venous gas in adults is a rare entity. The most frequent cause is intestinal ischemia. However, an increasing number of cases associated with benign conditions suitable for conservative treatment are being reported. We review the literature to define the clinical significance of portal venous gas, the role of computed tomography, and the need to perform emergency exploratory laparotomy.
__label__0, The antitank-antipersonnel weapons of this invention are synergistic combinations of lens-compromising agents, radar-compromising agents, and human irritants. The lens-compromising agents opaque the external lenses of tank periscopes and gunsights, and the radar-compromising agents block radar signals, forcing tank crews to navigate tanks and aim weapons by direct observation through open hatches, and to don "gas" masks for protection against the human irritants. The lenses of protective masks are also opaqued by the weapons of this invention, and when they are, tanks, tank crews, and other personnel are functionally blind and unable to fight.

__label__0, The protection of children from secondhand smoke in their homes remains a key objective for health agencies worldwide. While research has explored how parents can influence the introduction of home smoking restrictions, less attention has been paid to the role of wider familial and social networks as conduits for positive behaviour changes. In this article we explore how people living in Scotland have introduced various home smoking restrictions to reduce or eliminate children's exposure to tobacco smoke, and how some have gone on to influence people in their wider familial and social networks. The results suggest that many parents are willing to act on messages on the need to protect children from smoke, leading to the creation of patterns of smoking behaviour that are passed on to their parents and siblings and, more widely, to friends and visitors. However, while some parents and grandparents apparently voluntarily changed their smoking behaviour, other parents found that they had to make direct requests to family members and some needed to negotiate more forcefully to protect children, albeit often with positive results.
__label__0, A total of 481 K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca strains from different sources was examined with respect to sensitivity to normal human serum. K. oxytoca strains much more frequently proved to be serum resistant than K. pneumoniae isolates. Environmental strains of both species showed greater serum sensitivity than fecal or clinical isolates. While K. oxytoca strains isolated from feces and clinical specimens showed similar frequencies of serum resistant isolates, fecal K. pneumoniae strains less often were serum resistant than clinical K. pneumoniae isolates. Clinical Klebsiella strains appear to be more related to strains isolated from feces than to those isolated from the environment.
__label__0, In this work, the performance of a unified formal analytical solution for the simulation of atmospheric diffusion problems under stable conditions is evaluated. The eigenquantities required by the formal analytical solution are obtained by solving numerically the associated eigenvalue problem based on a newly developed algorithm capable of being used in high orders and without missing eigenvalues. The performance of the formal analytical solution is evaluated by comparing the converged predicted results against the observed values in the stable runs of the Prairie Grass experiment as well as the simulated results available in the literature. It was found that the developed algorithm was efficient and that the convergence rate depends on the stability condition and the considered parametrizations for wind speed and turbulence. The comparisons among predicted and observed concentrations showed a good agreement and indicate that the considered dispersion formulations are appropriate to simulate dispersion under slightly to moderate atmospheric stable conditions.
__label__0, In this paper, we propose an analog circuit for binary neural firing model that can extract various image features. Both computational and hardware models were designed for feature extraction algorithm that explores the dependency of firing rates on the pixel intensity in alignment with inhibition and excitation principles. The circuit for translating each pixel intensity into a series of pulses is implemented using a well timed circuit consisting of a series of difference circuits, comparators for thresholding, memory circuits and resistive networks for averaging. The circuit can be configured to select a required number of inhibition and excitation pixels, and can be used to generate a range of filtered signals from different sized filter windows. The difference between the features from different sized filter windows are used to extract the fine to coarse features from the images reflected as image edges, background features, and object textures.
__label__0, Mobile devices supporting multiple radio technologies are becoming mainstream in the market. These devices can experience vertical handovers between heterogeneous networks due to device mobility or multiple network coverage. Handover latency is critical to ensure session continuity and end user experience. This paper presents a solution using IEEE 802.21 to enable seamless mobility for data and video streaming sessions. The solution was implemented and evaluated using commercial wireless networks and mobile devices. Lab and field trial results show minimal handover delay and improved user experience.

This publication continues the series of thematic articles of the authors devoted to the logical errors in the expert conclusions. The preparation of further publications is underway to report the results of the in-depth analysis of the logical errors encountered in expert conclusions, text-books, guidelines, and manuals.
__label__0, Geo-replicated storage systems are at the core of current Internet services. The designers of the replication protocols used by these systems must choose between either supporting low-latency, eventually-consistent operations, or ensuring strong consistency to ease application correctness. We propose an alternative consistency model, Explicit Consistency, that strengthens eventual consistency with a guarantee to preserve specific invariants defined by the applications. Given these application-specific invariants, a system that supports Explicit Consistency identifies which operations would be unsafe under concurrent execution, and allows programmers to select either violation-avoidance or invariant-repair techniques. We show how to achieve the former, while allowing operations to complete locally in the common case, by relying on a reservation system that moves coordination off the critical path of operation execution. The latter, in turn, allows operations to execute without restriction, and restore invariants by applying a repair operation to the database state. We present the design and evaluation of Indigo, a middleware that provides Explicit Consistency on top of a causally-consistent data store. Indigo guarantees strong application invariants while providing similar latency to an eventually-consistent system in the common case.
__label__0, Denotational descriptions are frequently presented in terms of a sequence of descriptions of programming languages of increasing complexity. We discuss a formal approach to the study of such description sequences in terms of a refinement relation, showing how the informal use made of this approach in tutorial introductions to denotational semantics may be formally justified.
__label__0, The formulation and solution of a new algorithm for queue management and coordination of traffic signals along oversaturated arterials are presented. Existing traffic-control and signal-coordination algorithms deal only with undersaturated steady-state traffic flow conditions. No practical algorithms are readily available for oversaturated flow conditions. The main idea of the procedure is to manage queue formation and dissipation on system links so that traffic flow is maximized by efficiently using all green time, preventing formation of de facto red, accounting for the non-steady-state conditions, and providing time-dependent control measures. The problem is formulated as a throughput maximization problem subject to state and control variables. The solution is then obtained using genetic algorithms. The results show that the control procedure can produce dynamic and responsive control so that traffic progression is attained and all undesirable conditions such as queue spill-back and de facto red are avoided.
__label__0, Planning whole-body motions while taking into account the terrain conditions is a challenging problem for legged robots since the terrain model might produce many local minima. Our coupled planning method uses stochastic and derivatives-free search to plan both foothold locations and horizontal motions due to the local minima produced by the terrain model. It jointly optimizes body motion, step duration and foothold selection, and it models the terrain as a cost-map. Due to the novel attitude planning method, the horizontal motion plans can be applied to various terrain conditions. The attitude planner ensures the robot stability by imposing limits to the angular acceleration. Our whole-body controller tracks compliantly trunk motions while avoiding slippage, as well as kinematic and torque limits. Despite the use of a simplified model, which is restricted to flat terrain, our approach shows remarkable capability to deal with a wide range of noncoplanar terrains. The results are validated by experimental trials and comparative evaluations in a series of terrains of progressively increasing complexity.
__label__0, Characterizing the interplay between the vortices and forces acting on a wind turbine's blades in a qualitative and quantitative way holds the potential for significantly improving large wind turbine design. This paper introduces an integrated pipeline for highly effective wind and force field analysis and visualization. We extract vortices induced by a turbine's rotation in a wind field, and characterize vortices in conjunction with numerically simulated forces on the blade surfaces as these vortices strike another turbine's blades downstream. The scientifically relevant issue to be studied is the relationship between the extracted, approximate locations on the blades where vortices strike the blades and the forces that exist in those locations. This integrated approach is used to detect and analyze turbulent flow that causes local impact on the wind turbine blade structure. The results that we present are based on analyzing the wind and force field data sets generated by numerical simulations, and allow domain scientists to relate vortex-blade interactions with power output loss in turbines and turbine life expectancy. Our methods have the potential to improve turbine design to save costs related to turbine operation and maintenance.

__label__0, The phylogenetic relationships among the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the chrysophyte Ochromonas danica, and the oomycete Achyla bisexualis were explored by comparing the sequences of their small-subunit ribosomal RNA coding regions. Comparisons of similarity values or inspection of phylogenetic trees constructed by distance matrix methods reveal a very close relationship between oomycetes and chrysophytes. The separation of chrysophytes from chlorophytes is comparable to that of plants from animals, and both separations are far antedated by the divergence of a number of other protist groups.
__label__0, Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are pervasive, severe, and largely independent of the positive and negative symptoms of the illness. These deficits are increasingly considered to be core features of schizophrenia with evidence that the extent of cognitive impairment is the most salient predictor of daily functioning. Unfortunately, current schizophrenia treatment has been limited in addressing the cognitive deficits of the illness. Alterations in neuroplasticity are hypothesized to underpin these cognitive deficits, though preserved neuroplasticity may offer an avenue towards cognitive remediation. Key neuroplastic principles to consider in designing remediation interventions include ensuring sufficient intensity and duration of remediation programs, "bottom-up" training that proceeds from simple to complex cognitive processes, and individual tailoring of remediation regimens. We discuss several cognitive remediation programs, including cognitive enhancement therapy, which embrace these principles to target neurocognitive and social cognitive improvements and which havebeen demonstrated to be effective in schizophrenia. Future directions in cognitive remediation research include potential synergy with pharmacologic treatment, non-invasive stimulation techniques, and psychosocial interventions, identification of patient characteristics that predict outcome with cognitive remediation, and increasing the access to these interventions in front-line settings.
__label__0, The majority of computer vision applications assume that the camera adheres to the pin-hole camera model. However, most real optical systems will introduce some undesirable effects, rendering the assumption of the pin-hole camera model invalid. By far the most evident of these effects is radial distortion, particularly in fish-eye camera systems where the level of this distortion is relatively extreme. The aim of fish-eye distortion correction is, therefore, to transform the distorted view of fish-eye cameras to the desired rectilinear pin-hole perspective view. To perform this distortion correction, several authors have developed models of fish-eye distortion. It is the aim of this paper to examine the accuracy of several of the polynomial-based models against the equidistance mapping function, which is the most common mapping function that fish-eye lenses are designed to follow.
__label__0, The preparation and application of toxoplasmin for intradermal testing are described. The persistences of sensibility to toxoplasmin and the specificity of the test are discussed.
__label__0, Contemporary electricity distribution systems are being challenged by the variability of renewable energy sources. Slow response times and long energy management periods cannot efficiently integrate intermittent renewable generation and demand. Yet stochasticity can be judiciously coupled with system flexibilities to enhance grid operation efficiency. Voltage magnitudes for instance can transiently exceed regulation limits, while smart inverters can be overloaded over short time intervals. To implement such a mode of operation, an ergodic energy management framework is developed here. Considering a distribution grid with distributed energy sources and a feed-in tariff program, active power curtailment and reactive power compensation are formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. Tighter operational constraints are enforced in an average sense, while looser margins are enforced to be satisfied at all times. Stochastic dual subgradient solvers are developed based on exact and approximate grid models of varying complexity. Numerical tests on a real-world 56-bus distribution grid and the IEEE 123-bus test feeder relying on both grid models corroborate the advantages of the novel schemes over their deterministic alternatives.

__label__0, Abdominal pain is a very nonspecific sign that may be encountered in many diseases in children. The differentiation between acute abdomen and other pathologies may cause problems in many situations. The paper summarizes atypical causes of the acute abdomen which are rare but may be seen in the big, working hospital.
__label__0, We present a new dual watermarking and fingerprinting system, where initially all copies of a protected object are identically watermarked using a secret key, but individual detection keys are distinct. By knowing a detection key, an adversary cannot recreate the original content from the watermarked content. However, knowledge of any one detection key is sufficient for modifying the object so that a detector using that key would fail to detect the marks. Detectors using other detection keys would not be fooled, and such a modified object necessarily contains enough information about the broken detector key - the fingerprint. Our dual system limits the scope of possible attacks, when compared to classic fingerprinting systems. Under optimal attacks, the size of the collusion necessary to remove the marks without leaving a detectable fingerprint is superlinear in object size, whereas classic fingerprinting has a lower bound on collusion resistance that is approximately fourth root in object size. By using our scheme one can achieve collusion resistance of up to 900,000 users for a two hour high-definition video.
__label__0, We report a rare case of open dorsal dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint which needed operative reduction. A 39-year-old man injured his right middle finger while playing baseball. There was a laceration on the proximal interphalangeal crease, and the condyles of the proximal phalanx protruded through the wound. The flexor tendons had slipped behind the radial condyle, and made reduction impossible. After the flexor tendons and volar plate were replaced back into their normal position, the reduction was successful. Finally, the patient had full and painless motion of the digit. We review the reported cases of this injury in the relevant literature.

__label__0, The aim of this study was to report a case of factitious lymphedema of the arm and related lymphoscintigraphic aspects. The case of a 36-year-old patient is reported who started to present with pain, in the 3rd finger of the right hand three years prior to this report, which she associated with her work. Joint effusion was identified and treated using a splint that restricted blood flow leading to edema of the distal third of the forearm. Since then the patient was treated however her condition worsened resulting in edema of the entire arm. Subsequently she was referred to our service. A physical examination identified a restrictive band in the axillary region of the arm that delimited the edema. Volumetry and lymphoscintigraphic examinations of the limb were performed. The lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated acceleration of the flow in the affected limb and dermal reflux. Clinical treatment with removal of the restriction allowed a rapid reduction in the volume of the limb.
__label__0, Male rats were pretreated with phenobarbital for 5 days or received portacaval anastomosis 3 weeks before. Hexobarbital was applicated intravenously and hexobarbital plasma concentrations were followed up gaschromatographically in arterial blood samples. Hexobarbital clearance was calculated from the plasma concentration curve versus time. Liver microsomes were prepared and cytochrome P 450 and the hexobarbital oxidation rate was determined. After portacaval shunt the animals showed a small liver, a reduced cytochrome P 450 and diminished hexobarbital oxidation rate. Hexobarbital clearance in vivo was reduced, too. After phenobarbital pretreatment liver weight increased and cytochrome P 450 and hexobarbital oxidation rate were distinctly enhanced. The hexobarbital clearance in vivo were increased. Since the plot of hexobarbital clearance in vivo versus cytochrome P 450 or versus hexobarbital oxidation rate in vitro gave a good correlation, it is concluded that hexobarbital clearance in vivo may be a good estimate for hepatic cytochrome P 450 and hepatic hexobarbital oxidation rate.
__label__0, Implicit Wiener series are a powerful tool to build Volterra representations of time series with any degree of non-linearity. A natural question is then whether higher order representations yield more useful models. In this work we shall study this question for ECoG data channel relationships in epileptic seizure recordings, considering whether quadratic representations yield more accurate classifiers than linear ones. To do so we first show how to derive statistical information on the Volterra coefficient distribution and how to construct seizure classification patterns over that information. As our results illustrate, a quadratic model seems to provide no advantages over a linear one. Nevertheless, we shall also show that the interpretability of the implicit Wiener series provides insights into the inter-channel relationships of the recordings.

__label__0, A distributed algorithm is proposed in order to control block motion of a reconfigurable micro-electro-mechanical modular surface. The modular surface is designed to convey fragile and tiny micro-parts. The distributed algorithm solves a discrete trajectory optimization problem. In particular, the algorithm computes the shortest path between two points of the modular surface using a strategy based on minimum hop count. The proposed method based on distributed asynchronous iterative elections is scalable.
__label__0, The emergence of cloud computing brings users abundant opportunities to utilize the power of cloud to perform computation on data contributed by multiple users. These cloud data should be encrypted under multiple keys due to privacy concerns. However, existing secure computation techniques are either limited to single key or still far from practical. In this paper, we design two efficient schemes for secure outsourced computation over cloud data encrypted under multiple keys. Our schemes employ two non-colluding cloud servers to jointly compute polynomial functions over multiple users' encrypted cloud data without learning the inputs, intermediate or final results, and require only minimal interactions between the two cloud servers but not the users. We demonstrate our schemes' efficiency experimentally via applications in machine learning. Our schemes are also applicable to privacy-preserving data aggregation such as in smart metering.
__label__0, In recent years, gesture-based interaction methods are supported by a wide variety of devices, such as capacitive trackpads and capacitive 3D gesture recognition systems. Capacitive interaction systems are often integrated into laptops, but can also be installed ubiquitously under any kind of non-conductive surface - for example under a table. When interacting with such proximity-sensing surfaces, users often face the challenge that the affordances are often not directly apparent. Moreover, most devices have no ability to provide feedback, which is often only displayed on a complementary screen, not in the area in which the interaction takes place. In order to solve these problems, we present an approach which combines a semi-transparent capacitive proximity-sensing surface with an LED array. The LEDs are used to visually indicate possible gestural movements and provide feedback on the current interaction status.

Hofman and colleagues introduce a new insulin pen needle, the NovoTwist, to simplify injections to a small group of children and adolescents. Their overall preferences and evaluation of the handling of the needle are reported in the study. This new needle has the potential to ease administration of insulin via a pen device that may increase both the use of a pen device and adherence to insulin therapy.

__label__0, We describe an implementation of a threads library that provides extremely lightweight threads within a single uNrx process while allowing fully concurrent access to system resources. The threads are lighnveight enough so that they can be created quickly, there can be thousands present, and synchronization can be accomplished rapidly. These goals are achieved by providing user threads which multiplex on a pool of ketnel-supported threads of control. This pool is managed by the library and will automatically grow or shrink as required to ensure that the process will make progress while not using an excessive amount of kernel resources. The programmer can also tune the relationship between threads and kernel supported threads of control. This paper focuses on scheduling and synchronizing user threads, and their interaction with uNlx sigrrals in a multiplexing threads library.
__label__0, This study was conducted to evaluate the complications occurring during operation and from the time of operation until the follow-up vist at one to eight weeks after operation, for patients sterilized by culdoscopy, colpotomy, laparoscopy, or laparotomy. Surgeons were unable to perform the elected procedure in less than 1 per cent of the patients, independent of the method of approach. With endoscopic techniques, the most common operative difficulty was in obtaining an adequate view of the tubes. Excessive blood loss appeared more frequent with both vaginal techniques. Postoperatively, pelvic infections were more frequent with both the vaginal techniques, while incisional complications were more frequent with both the abdominal techniques. Operative and hospitalization times were significantly shorter, and the proportion of women resuming normal activities within four weeks of sterilization was higher with the endoscopic methods. Laparoscopy appeared to be the preferable procedure. While technical difficulties, operative complications, surgical and hospitalization times, and the time until the patient resumed normal work activities were similar with laparoscopy and culdoscopy; infection of the pelvis was more frequent after culdoscopy.

The effect is enhanced by the insertion of a quarter-wave plate. The contrast of lenticular discontinuities is consequently greatly accentuated. This makes it possible to quantify them.
__label__0, Polycystic hepatic disease is a very rare hereditary disease. Most of the patients have no symptoms but sometimes they present abdominal discomfort, fever, jaundice. Almost half of the patients associate renal cysts. Rarely, the cysts may appear in other organs such as the pancreas, the spleen or the lung. We present a case of polycystic hepatic disease. In our patient the cysts replace almost the entire hepatic structure. However, the hepatic functional tests were normal.
__label__0, We present a framework for designing run-time fault- tolerance using dynamic program updates triggered by faults. This is an important problem in the design of autonomous systems as it is often the case that a running program needs to be upgraded to its fault-tolerant version once faults occur. We formally state fault-triggered program updates as a design problem. We then present a sound and complete algorithm that automates the design of fault- triggered updates for replacing a program that does not tolerate faults with a fault-tolerant version thereof at run-time. We also define three classes of fault-triggered dynamic updates that tolerate faults during the update. We demonstrate our approach in the context of a fault-triggered update for the gate controller of a parking lot.
__label__0, Industrial power systems, whether low-voltage or medium-voltage systems, are the backbone of any industrial facility. To keep production going and minimize downtimes, they are required to be very reliable. Therefore, it is important to deploy various protection systems to detect and react appropriately to any abnormal condition that can lead to a failure to deliver power or to a hazardous condition. Ground faults are the most common condition experienced by a power system. Hence, the ability to detect and react as needed quickly is paramount. The goal of this paper is to help protection engineers, engineering consultants, and power system operators to apply ground-fault protection systems correctly while also complying with local electrical codes.
__label__0, Evidence has begun to accumulate which suggests that lack of awareness of illness in schizophrenia is related to and possibly the result of a cognitive deficit involving prefrontal cerebral dysfunction. This study further explores this relationship along with other domains of self-awareness in chronic schizophrenics and other subjects with serious mental disorders. One hundred eight schizophrenics and 21 bipolar subjects from three separate sites in Britain, Germany, and Canada were administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and three measures of self-awareness. Lack of illness awareness and other domains of self-knowledge were significantly more related to poorer neuropsychological performance in schizophrenia patients than in the other subjects. The results support the hypothesis that lack of illness awareness is related to defective frontal lobe functioning as indexed by neuropsychological measures.
__label__0, Insulin-like growth factors are present in the circulation and are also synthesized by osteoblasts so that they may function both as systemic and local regulators of bone growth. Production of insulin-like growth factors in bone are under the control of parathyroid hormone, estrogen and growth hormone. Cytokines, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption, and are under inhibitory control of estrogen. Bone loss associated with age and menopause may be due in part to removal of this inhibitory influence upon cytokines production.
__label__0, Abstract Novel algorithms for line and line network extraction from images are proposed. The algorithms which operate on region adjacency graphs are developed especially for images that are noisy and have low contrast. Microscopic images of fibers are used as an example application. The proposed algorithms are very general in nature, since they can detect lines of arbitrary geometry. The region adjacency graph is constructed from a segmented version of the original image. The segmentation process is based on the watershed transformation which is widely used in morphological image analysis. A Laplacian-type operation for line detection on the region adjacency graph is presented and removal of noise structures is studied. Fast algorithms for the detection of line ends and line branches are proposed. In addition, a directional propagation algorithm is derived. The line-end and branch-detection algorithms as well as directional propagations use only the adjacency information of the region adjacency graph. Finally, a complete line-network-extraction system is presented. The performance of the proposed algorithms is studied and a comparison between algorithms operating on the square grid and on the region adjacency graph is made.

__label__0, The experimental tests are very important in the study of electromagnetic devices. They are employed for validation of theoretical models, determination of parameters and assessment of operating characteristics. In the specific case of the linear induction machine, the test facilities are relatively expensive and complex. This paper presents the development of a simple and low cost three-phase sector induction machine, built from a rotating single-phase induction machine. Because of its physical configuration, the sector machine can be employed to emulate a linear induction one. The description of the construction of the sector machine is presented as well as the winding characteristics and the results of initial tests. Experimental results are compared to theoretical ones based on an equivalent circuit model.
__label__0, A method is described which permits the examination of the influences of increasing age and body weight on organ weights. Polynomial multivariate analysis is performed by computer, and the predicted organ weight values permit the construction of three dimensional graphs which show the influence on organ weight of all combinations of age and body weight. The application of the method will allow the physical biology of organisms to be determined with considerable precision over their life span.
__label__0, End users often need the ability to tailor diagramming-based design tools and to specify dynamic interactive behaviours of graphical user interfaces. However most want to avoid having to use textual scripting languages or programming language approaches directly. We describe a new visual language for user interface event handling specification targeted at end users. Our visual language provides end users with abstract ways to express both simple and complex event handling mechanisms via visual specifications. These specifications incorporate event filtering, tool state querying and action invocation. We describe our language, its incorporation into a meta-tool for building visual design environments, examples of its use and results of evaluations of its effectiveness.
__label__0, Summary Total, inorganic, and organic iodine of the tissues of normal and ANTU-poisoned rats was measured. ANTU decreased the thyroid iodine of rats and guinea pigs and caused a small increase in the total iodine of blood and lung when acutely toxic doses of the rodenticide were administered. Feeding a high iodine diet for 5 days caused a marked increase in the total iodine of tissues from normal and thyroidectomized rats. Since pre-treatment of thyroidectomized rats with iodine does not afford protection against ANTU the increase in thyroid iodine of normal iodine-fed rats appears to be involved directly in the prophylactic effect of iodide against ANTU poisoning.
__label__0, This paper proposes a new framework for data association to solve the problem of SLAM. The proposed framework has specific relevance to range scanner based EKF-SLAM. The resulting data representation enables semantic reasoning on a spatial level which reduces the misassociation of closely spaced data from different spatial configurations through the use of convex polygons to represent data from similar spatial configurations. The data representation is especially effective for association when revisiting previously mapped regions efficiently. The spatial data representation also builds an occupancy grid for the entire map. We also provide a means of clustering range scan data using an adaptive threshold to be able to divide data at various ranges into clusters and dense data clustering to get more accurate data.
__label__0, We propose a Web search site called "Cyclone", in which a user can retrieve encyclopedic term descriptions on the Web. Cyclone searches the Web for headwords and page fragments describing the headwords. High-quality page fragments are selected as term descriptions and are classified into domains. The number of current headwords is over 700,000.
__label__0, Most set expansion algorithms assume to acquire new instances of different semantic categories independently even when we have seed instances of multiple semantic categories. However, in the setting of set expansion with multiple semantic categories, we might leverage other types of prior knowledge about semantic categories. In this paper, we present a method of set expansion when ontological information related to target semantic categories is available. More specifically, the proposed method makes use of sibling relations between semantic categories as an additional type of prior knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sibling relations in set expansion on the dataset in which instances and sibling relations are extracted from Wikipedia in a semi-automatic manner.
__label__0, Simulium bite reaction is described; the lesions were present mainly on the lower legs as palpable purpura, which persisted for 2 weeks with marked oedema and considerable discomfort. Simuliids are tiny bloodsucking flies, popularly known as blackflies or buffalo flies, belonging to the dipterous family Simuliidae. They occur world-wide, breed in fast-flowing streams, and are a major animal pest. This is the first description of blackfly bites in man in the South African literature.
__label__0, Markov processes that have a product form solution have become an important computer performance modeling tool. The fact that such a simple solution exists for seemingly complex Markov processes is surprising at first encounter and can be established by showing that balance equations are satisfied. In this article we attempt to provide insight as to why such a solution form exists and demonstrate that product form and companion results, such as the arrival theorem and Norton's theorem, are consequences of four properties satisfied by queues that satisfy partial balance. Notions of reverse processes, reversibility, and quasireversibility are developed to establish the four properties
__label__0, A proven basic technique for the digital generation of two sine waves having a known and adjustable phase difference has been used to produce a commercial phase-angle standard. While the final performance for this instrument meets or exceeds those previously reported for a unit built by the National Bureau of Standards, a number of different circuit techniques have been used to achieve greater phase resolution, circuit simplifications, easier mechanisms for detecting possible circuit problems, and significant cost reductions.
__label__0, This version is made available in accordance with publisher policies. Please cite only the published version using the reference above. This paper presents EIT-based fabric sensors that aim to provide a pressure mapping using the current carrying and voltage sensing electrodes attached to the boundary of the fabric patch. Pressure-induced shape change over the sensor area makes a change in the conductivity distribution which can be conveyed to the change of boundary current-voltage data. This boundary data is obtained through electrode measurements in EIT system. The corresponding inverse problem is to reconstruct the pressure and deformation map from the relationship between the applied current and the measured voltage on the fabric boundary. Taking advantage of EIT in providing dynamical images of conductivity changes due to pressure induced shape change, the pressure map can be estimated. In this paper, the EIT-based fabric sensor was presented for circular and rectangular sensor geometry. A stretch sensitive fabric was used in circular sensor with 16 electrodes and a pressure sensitive fabric was used in a rectangular sensor with 32 electrodes. A preliminary human test was carried out with the rectangular sensor for foot pressure mapping showing promising results.

__label__0, We develop an online gradient algorithm for optimizing the performance of product-form networks through online adjustment of control parameters. The use of standard algorithms for finding optimal parameter settings is hampered by the prohibitive computational burden of calculating the gradient in terms of the stationary probabilities. The proposed approach instead relies on measuring empirical frequencies of the various states through simulation or online operation so as to obtain estimates for the gradient. Besides the reduction in computational effort, a further benefit of the online operation lies in the natural adaptation to slow variations in ambient parameters as commonly occurring in dynamic environments. On the downside, the measurements result in inherently noisy and biased estimates. We exploit mixing time results in order to overcome the impact of the bias and establish sufficient conditions for convergence to a globally optimal solution.
__label__0, In this paper we describe a system that can be used to generate action eeect speciications. Unlike those like STRIPS commonly used in AI planning, our system uses an action description language that allows one to specify the eeects of actions using domain rules, which are state constraints that can entail new action eeects from old ones. Declaratively, an action domain in our language corresponds to a non-monotonic causal theory in the situation calculus. Procedurally, such an action domain is compiled into a set of propositional theories, one for each action in the domain, from which fully instantiated successor state-like axioms and STRIPS-like systems are then generated. Theoretically , we show that the procedural semantics is sound with respect to the declarative semantics. Empirically, we have successfully tested our system on many benchmark planning domains, including most of those in McDermott's library of PDDL action domains.
__label__0, The mining industry is interested in tele-operation systems to remove mining operators from hazardous or inconvenient environments without losing efficiency. Technologies to enhance the operator's experience are advancing but there is a lack of evidence supporting the extent to which these emerging technologies positively affect user experience. In this paper, we describe three applications that make use of networked virtual and mixed reality. These prototype systems each represent a step towards new VR based technologies that will increase the efficiency and safety of the mining industry.
__label__0, We have made several observations during the course of our studies that show the presence of matrix effects in soft biological tissue and standards. The sputtering rate of gelatin is approximately twice that of epoxy resin, but the ion yield of lithium in gelatin is an order of magnitude less than in epoxy. Osmium impregnation of freeze-dried material significantly alters the localization of calcium, but not potassium and barium. The absolute count rate for calcium in osmicated tissue is increased several-fold above that in freeze-dried tissue. Scanning electron microscopy of sputtered material shows the formation of cones during sputtering, which is particularly, but not exclusively, associated with melanin granules and red blood cells. These structures are known to be highly emissive for Na, K, and Ca. Boron implanted tissue also exhibits selective boron emission from melanin granules. Relative proportions of monoatomic and polyatomic emission vary in epoxy, gelatin and tissue. Ion images of carbon, chlorine and vanadium in tissue embedded with a vanadium-doped epoxy resin show variations in local regions that correspond to tissue structure. The energy distributions of common secondary ions differed somewhat in resin and two different tissue regions. These examples show the existence of potential matrix effects in soft biological tissue that involve both differential sputtering and ion yield effects.
__label__0, We proposed a confocal laser scanning microscopy based on dual-comb spectroscopy, which enables the three-dimensional quantitative amplitude and phase imaging.
__label__0, Harmonic colors are sets of colors that are aesthetically pleasing in terms of human visual perception. In this paper, we present a method that enhances the harmony among the colors of a given photograph or of a general image, while remaining faithful, as much as possible, to the original colors. Given a color image, our method finds the best harmonic scheme for the image colors. It then allows a graceful shifting of hue values so as to fit the harmonic scheme while considering spatial coherence among colors of neighboring pixels using an optimization technique. The results demonstrate that our method is capable of automatically enhancing the color "look-and-feel" of an ordinary image. In particular, we show the results of harmonizing the background image to accommodate the colors of a foreground image, or the foreground with respect to the background, in a cut-and-paste setting. Our color harmonization technique proves to be useful in adjusting the colors of an image composed of several parts taken from different sources.
__label__0,     In recent years, matrix completion methods have been successfully applied to solve recommender system applications. Most of them focus on the matrix completion problem in real number domain, and produce continuous prediction values. However, these methods are not appropriate in some occasions where the entries of matrix are discrete values, such as movie ratings prediction, social network relation and interaction prediction, because their continuous outputs are not probabilities and uninterpretable. In this case, an additional step to process the continuous results with either heuristic threshold parameters or complicated mapping is necessary, while it is inefficient and may diverge from the optimal solution. There are a few matrix completion methods working on discrete number domain, however, they are not applicable to sparse and large-scale data set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal discrete matrix completion model, which is able to learn optimal thresholds automatically and also guarantees an exact low-rank structure of the target matrix. We use stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentum method to optimize the new objective function and speed up optimization. In the experiments, it is proved that our method can predict discrete values with high accuracy, very close to or even better than these values obtained by carefully tuned thresholds on Movielens and YouTube data sets. Meanwhile, our model is able to handle online data and easy to parallelize.   
__label__0, The ability to display a broad variety of colors has great benefits not only in the context of entertainment but also as a means to streamline design in prototyping and manufacturing processes. Displays that use RGB filters or backlights cannot span all colors that occur in nature. To improve the accuracy of color reproduction, there have been attempts to include additional color primaries in displays. Existing solutions, however, have an impact on cost, scalability, and spatial resolution and are predominantly applicable to projection systems. We propose an approach based on combining diffraction grating extractors and the HANS imaging pipeline initially developed for printing. This combination offers unprecedented potential to attain large color gamuts with the same backlights commercially used today.

__label__0, Disk drives experience a wide range of temperature and humidity during storage and operation. Humidity influences media tribology through the effects of adsorbed water on the interaction of Zdol lubricant hydroxyl end groups with the carbon overcoat. We measured the effects of Zdol 4000 thickness and chemisorption on the water adsorption isotherm and surface energy. The potential distortion model of Adamson was employed to derive the film thickness at saturation from the isotherms and contact angles. The isotherm was surprisingly independent of the Zdol chemisorption and thickness up to 1.8 nm, because, in this range of Zdol thickness, the adsorbed water resides in pores which exclude the larger Zdol end groups. The water adsorption isotherm provides a sensitive probe of overcoat structure due the ability of water to reach pores in the overcoat which are inaccessible to Zdol. Above a Zdol thickness of 1.8 nm there is a jump in the water adsorption as additional adsorption takes place on the "free" hydroxyl groups. The mechanism for the previously observed decrease in Zdol lubricated media durability at low humidity is derived from the effect of adsorbed water on Zdol surface diffusion and chemisorption.

__label__0, The work which I have done in this field has been mainly in collaboration with Dr J. E. Vance, and I wish to thank him for his assistance in preparing this contribution. As it is impossible in a single paper to cover completely the vast field of hormonal control of carbohydrate metabolism, this paper will deal only with the pancreatic-enteric group of hormones, ie, insulin, glucagon, gastrin, pancreozymin, secretin, and a glucagon-like immunoreactive material in the gut. This means that the following hormonesgrowth hormone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, glucocorticoids, catecholamines, oestrogens, and placental lactogen-some of which are of great importance in carbohydrate metabolism, will not be discussed unless their actions in some way impinge upon the hormone under discussion.
__label__0, Recent 'studentification' processes raise issues regarding the positive and negative impacts of student influx on the urban environment. The positive impacts discussed in the literature include urban core revitalization, employment generation and economic growth. The negative externalities comprise the formation of temporary sub-communities, competition with low-income groups in the rental housing market, and an increase in traffic volume. The current study adds to the literature by focusing on the influence of student influx on rent prices. The importance of this issue derives from the need to understand the net effect of the contradicting impacts of 'studentification' on contemporary urban development for policy implications. While student influx is considered a promising force of urban regeneration, in the literature concerns were raised regarding the detrimental effect of students' temporary sub-communities. The impact of 'studentification' on rent prices is evaluated by hedonic property price analysis incorporating spatial correlations. Data were collected from on-line real-estate portals advertising apartments for rent in the city of Haifa, Israel. The data include apartments characterized by more than a dozen relevant attributes to rental apartment choice including rent price, location, structural features, furniture and electrical appliances. Locations with high proportions of students in the private rented sector were identified on the basis of municipal tax files, as students in Haifa are eligible for substantial municipal tax discounts. The results of this study show the rent price differential between apartments of comparable characteristics located in 'studentified' and 'non-studentified' zones. The paper concludes with a discussion regarding the policy implications of the findings.
__label__0, This paper proposes a new strategy for a humanoid robot to approach and operate a valve based on colour and shape constraints. It consists of four stages, namely rough base approaching, fine base approaching, rough hand approaching and fine hand approaching and grasping. The robot estimates the object's position using its stereo-vision at the first stage. A new visual positioning method is used to determine the valve's position and pose in the robot's frame in the second stage. When its hands are near the valve, a visual servoing method is employed to catch the handle of the valve via cameras in end-effectors. The advantages of both eye-in-head and eye-to-hand systems are exploited. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
__label__0, In this work, we develop a fully Bayesian method for the calculation of probability distributions of single-exponential rates for any single-molecule process. These distributions can even be derived when no transitions from one state to another have been observed, since in that case the data can be used to estimate a lower bound on the rate. Using a Bayesian hypothesis test, one can easily test whether a transition occurs at the same rate or at different rates in two data sets. We illustrate these methods with molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of a beta-sheet protein. However, the theory presented here can be used on any data from simulation or experiment for which a two-state description is appropriate.

__label__0, Although the open government concept is not new, current trends in open government imply a change in focus from the traditional principle of accountability to a concept of citizen empowerment, collaboration and information sharing. In this paper, we explore the use of open data and mobile apps in the top countries according to the UN 2010 e-Government Survey. Our exploration suggests that, although not all countries yet offer mobile apps to their citizens, there is a great diversity of apps to create citizen value. Moreover, private companies and citizens are getting involved in the creation of such apps. More research is needed to understand ways to promote the development of this kind of government applications.
__label__0, One of the main problems that emerges in the classic approach to semantics is the difficulty in acquisition and maintenance of ontologies and semantic annotations. On the other hand, the Internet explosion and the massive diffusion of mobile smart devices lead to the creation of a worldwide system, which information is daily checked and fueled by the contribution of millions of users who interacts in a collaborative way. Search engines, continually exploring the Web, are a natural source of information on which to base a modern approach to semantic annotation. A promising idea is that it is possible to generalize the semantic similarity, under the assumption that semantically similar terms behave similarly, and define collaborative proximity measures based on the indexing information returned by search engines. The PMING Distance is a proximity measure used in data mining and information retrieval, which collaborative information express the degree of relationship between two terms, using only the number of documents returned as result for a query on a search engine. In this work, the PMINIG Distance is updated, providing a novel formal algebraic definition, which corrects previous works. The novel point of view underlines the features of the PMING to be a locally normalized linear combination of the Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalized Google Distance. The analyzed measure dynamically reflects the collaborative change made on the web resources.

__label__0, We consider the problem of efficiently allocating simulation effort to determine which of several simulated systems have mean performance exceeding a known threshold. This determination is known as multiple comparisons with a control. Within a Bayesian formulation, the optimal fully sequential policy for allocating simulation effort is the solution to a dynamic program. We show that this dynamic program can be solved efficiently, providing a tractable way to compute the Bayes-optimal policy. The solution uses techniques from optimal stopping and multi-armed bandits. We then present further theoretical results characterizing this Bayes-optimal policy, compare it numerically to several approximate policies, and apply it to an application in ambulance positioning.
__label__0, We revisit the problem of synthesis of service composition in the context of service oriented architecture from a tree automata perspective. Comparing to existing finite state machine and graph-based approaches to the problem of service composition, tree automata offers a more flexible and faithful modeling of multi-input services and their admissible compositions. In our framework, tree automata is used to express both type signature constraints of individual services as well as constraints on the order in which services must be invoked. To synthesize service compositions, users may provide optional specifications on the desired composite service. The user specifications are also expressed as tree automata. We employ a combination of tree automata algorithms to compute the set of all possible valid service compositions which satisfy the user specifications.
__label__0, Impaired would healing is a known adverse effect of chronic immunosuppression. Solid-organ transplant recipients undergoing major abdominal surgery have an increased risk of wound-related complications compared with the general population. In this subset of patients, surgical site infections and wound dehiscence must be aggressively treated to avoid sepsis, graft loss, and death. Recently, topical application of platelet-rich plasma has been proposed as an alternative therapeutic option to enhance wound healing in difficult cases. Unfortunately, randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma compared with standard or advanced wound management are lacking, and the literature mostly refers to anecdotal reports in patients with no evidence of wound infection. This report documents a kidney transplant recipient who experienced spontaneous bladder rupture because of gangrenous cystitis. After an exploratory laparotomy and bladder repair, the patient developed a deep surgical site infection by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and extensive wound dehiscence. Advanced wound management and vacuum-assisted closure therapy were ineffective. Topical homologous platelet-rich gel was used resulting in significant wound healing, without infections or immunologic complications.
__label__0, The chorio-allantoic membrane of explanted chick embryos can be used for the study of vascular development and of the vascular response to drugs and to tissue implants or tissue extracts. Three different types of vials for shell-less cultivation of chick embryos were compared in terms of short-term survival. Plastic cups with rounded bottoms were superior to Petri dishes and polyethylene film bags, in that they combined a high survival rate of the embryos with a possibility of using a large number of embryos in each experiment. With the use of plastic cups this method is simple, reliable and inexpensive.
__label__0, A conserved aspartic acid residue in transmembrane helix 3 of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is important in binding the headgroup of muscarinic ligands. This acidic amino acid probably points into a relatively hydrophilic cavity whose walls are formed by the amphipathic transmembrane helices of the receptor. Amino acid side chains within this cavity contribute to ligand binding.
__label__0, Ischemic colitis is a frequent disorder of large bowel in elderly persons or in debilitated patients with a variable underlying medical problems. Ischemic colitis may result from alterations in the systemic circulation or anatomic or functional changes in the local mesenteric vasculature. In most cases, no specific cause for the ischemic colitis is identified. Cases of ischemic colitis after enema for bowel cleansing have been rarely reported, but there has been no case report after normal saline enema. We report a case of ischemic colitis in a 72-year old patient with well-controlled hypertension, presenting as bloody diarrhea which developed after normal saline enema for preoperative bowel cleansing.
__label__0, In this paper, we describe a formal language for a class of logical expressions. We then present a Finite State Machine for recognition and evaluation of this language. The main interest of the language is its historical characteristic. This language invented by the British scholar W. Stanley JEVONS in 1865 is probably the earliest language in which expressions were evaluated by a Finite State Machine. The two outstanding contributions were the use of machinery to evaluate formulas and the evaluation of formulas with variables by several parallel evaluations with constants. The contribution of this paper is to present this ancient evaluation process in a contemporary framework, i.e. formal languages and finite state automata. The design of an evaluator is given in great detail.

The sensors of the implemented control system including the Zinc-Copper battery and the photodiode are selected from the conventional low-cost soil tester. The input resistance of the receiver circuit is designed to be as low as possible to keep the weak signals of the measured moisture and illumination from noise interference. The embedded functions of the micro-controller such as the analog-digital conversion, the low power precision timer and the sleep mode, are key factors in this application.

__label__0, Many cloud providers offer on demand applications as BPaaS "Business Process as a Service" through multi-tenant cloud platforms, allowing many companies to outsource their business processes. That is, an increasing amount of personal data involved in business processes is automatically gathered and stored on the cloud. For cost saving, some fragments of business processes can be reused i.e., shared between the clients on the cloud regardless of privacy risks. In this paper, we propose an anonymization-based approach to preserve the client business activity while sharing process fragments between organizations on the cloud.

__label__0, In this paper, a simple method for generating correlated Rayleigh-fading envelopes with any desired correlation factor is proposed. In addition, based on a process of apparition and vanishing of same-delay correlated rays, a time-varying impulse response model of the indoor radio channel is developed with the aid of the proposed method. This proposal provides a straightforward tool for simulating the variant behavior of wireless channels.
__label__0, We present a simple and high-quality 3D scanning system based on structured light. It uses the common setup of a video projector, a computer-controlled turntable and a single camera. Geometry is acquired using a combination of gray code and phase-shift projections, and it is stored and processed in a point-based representation. We achieve high accuracy by careful calibration of camera, projector, and turntable axis. In addition, we make use of the projector's calibration and extend it to a calibrated light source, allowing for a simple reconstruction of material properties for each surface point. We alternatively use a Lambertian reflectance model, or fit a Phong reflectance model to the samples under different turntable orientations. The acquisition pipeline is entirely point-based, avoiding the need of triangulation during all processing stages.

Though parties have long been encouraged to settle their disputes outside court, the use of mediators has been authorized only since January 2011, when the Russian law on mediation went into effect. Judicial officials hoped that the introduction of mediation would diminish the punishing caseload by diverting cases. Scholars and community activists hoped that mediation would open a route to greater societal harmony by allowing disputants a greater role in resolving their own problems. Significant sums were poured into creating mediation centers across Russia, many of which organized
__label__0, One of the most intuitive ways to classically understand the generation of natural optical activity in chiral media is provided by the coupled oscillator model of Born and Kuhn consisting of two identical, vertically displaced, coupled oscillators. We experimentally realize and discuss its exact plasmonic analog in a system of corner-stacked gold nanorods. In particular, we analyze the arising circular dichroism and optical rotatory spectra in terms of hybridized electromagnetic modes and retardation. Specifically, we demonstrate how tuning the vertical distance between the nanorods can lead to a selective excitation of the occurring bonding and antibonding chiral plasmonic modes.

__label__0, The Olympic Games ranking is done through lexicographic multi criteria method in each period. According to this method, the country receiving the most gold medals will have the highest score, and in case of having equal silver medals, comparison will be done according to bronze ones. The problem of this method is to pay the most attention merely to gold medals. Using data envelopment analysis, some studies have recently suggested various ranking for the Olympic Games. The present research uses DEA to rank the participating Asian countries in London Olympic that have at least won one medal. As an output-oriented BCC model, this one considers the number of male and female athletes, received medals in two previous Olympic as well as the number of their presence in the Olympic games as the inputs. Gold, silver and bronze medals are the only output of the model. This model is solved in two forms of female and male athlete combination and their separation. Solving this model makes this opportunity to present a new rankings model for participating Asian countries in the Olympic Games that can be compared with the ranking used by Olympic committee.

__label__0, Cost-effective biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass depends on efficient degradation of the plant cell wall. One of the major obstacles for the development of a cost-efficient process is the lack of resistance of currently used fungal enzymes to harsh conditions such as high temperature. Adapted, thermophilic microbial communities provide a huge reservoir of potentially interesting lignocellulose-degrading enzymes for improvement of the cellulose hydrolysis step. In order to identify such enzymes, a leaf and wood chip compost was enriched on a mixture of thermo-chemically pretreated wheat straw, poplar and Miscanthus under thermophile conditions, but in two different set-ups. Unexpectedly, metagenome sequencing revealed that incubation of the lignocellulosic substrate with compost as inoculum in a suspension culture resulted in an impoverishment of putative cellulase- and hemicellulase-encoding genes. However, mimicking composting conditions without liquid phase yielded a high number and diversity of glycoside hydrolase genes and an enrichment of genes encoding cellulose binding domains. These identified genes were most closely related to species from Actinobacteria, which seem to constitute important players of lignocellulose degradation under the applied conditions. The study highlights that subtle changes in an enrichment set-up can have an important impact on composition and functions of the microcosm. Composting-like conditions were found to be the most successful method for enrichment in species with high biomass degrading capacity.

__label__0, Medical decision-support systems in which uncertainty plays an essential role are increasingly based on the formalism of probabilistic networks. Although this formalism is very powerful, the construction of actual networks is not straightforward, and requires the availability of clearly structured medical domain models as a starting point. In this paper it is argued that medical pathophysiological knowledge constitutes a good start for the development of such models, even though pathophysiological knowledge is semantically different from probabilistic knowledge. Two models concerning anaemia, which are part of a broad system covering the domain of anaemia, are discussed to illustrate the general approach.

__label__0, This paper presents an adaptive tracking controller for a two-vehicle convoy where the lead vehicle is driven in reverse. We assume that the lead vehicle linear and angular velocities are unknown constant parameters. We discuss autonomous vehicle control without any information obtained from road infrastructure or communicated from the lead vehicle. The only information the robot vehicle can use for feedback control is the relative position and orientation with respect to the lead vehicle obtained from onboard sensing. The control velocities of the ego-vehicle are computed using the leader velocity estimates obtained from the dynamic part of the proposed controller. For constant velocity maneuvers of the leader, at steady state, the two-vehicle convoy will travel concentric arcs of same radii with prescribed inter-vehicle spacing. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller
__label__0, Effect of glazing with an ultraviolet light-activated coating material on reduction of the leaching of methyl methacrylate and formaldehyde from denture acrylic resins was quantitatively evaluated. Disks prepared from auto-polymerized resins were painted with the material and radiated with ultraviolet light. The disks were immersed in artificial saliva and the concentrations of methyl methacrylate and formaldehyde leached were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and flow injection analysis. Compared to untreated controls, the glaze significantly decreased concentrations of both leachable substances. Treatment with an ultraviolet light-activated coating material is effective in suppressing the leaching of methyl methacrylate and formaldehyde from acrylic resins as well as in smoothing the denture surfaces.
__label__0, In the HCI community a number of pattern catalogues were created during the last years. Due to the nature of such patterns they are often described high-level and abstract. In this paper we present an approach to translate at least a certain kind of patterns into a machine readable form, while keeping them abstract in terms of problem independence. Those translated HCI patterns can be used for a semi-automated MDA-procedure using device-and mapping definitions. Also an example for this development cycle, a sequence of pattern-based transformations, is presented.

In this paper I present data to show the macroscopic electronic phase separation that is caused by either mobile doping or electronic instability in the overdoped region. My results clearly demonstrate that the electronic inhomogeneity is probably a general feature of high-temperature superconductors.
__label__0, The aim of this study was to standardise a method for the in vitro culture of hypertrophic prostatic tissue, to assay the morphological type of isolated cells, to evaluate the degree of proliferation and to identify their differentiated iter. In addition, the effects of mepartricina on growth was also studied obtaining preliminary results. Of a total of 40 biopsies used in this experiment, 30 were placed directly in culture using Freshney's method, whereas the remaining 10 were used in a method involving the primary culture of the dispersed cells obtained from enzymatically disaggregated tissue. In vitro proliferation was analysed using optic microscopy, histological and histochemical techniques, and a scanning electron microscope. Cellular kinetics were also studied by bromodeoxyuridine marking. Using these tests it was found that it is possible to obtain the development and growth in this form of culture of fibroblastic-type colonies of epithelial origin characterised by different morphologies and growth curves. In addition, cells from the epithelioid colonies are characterised by a high level of proliferative activity and a low degree of differentiation. Mepartricina appears, on the other hand, to inhibit the in vitro growth of hypertrophic prostatic tissue.

The tractors had been invented by his father, Elisha Perkins of Connecticut, and were supposed to relieve pain and other symptoms through the agency of animal magnetism. The tractors were revealed as nothing more than an expensive sham by Dr John Haygarth in Bath, who showed that wooden tractors were equally effective. Thus, he was one of the first to use a placebo in a single-blind clinical trial.
__label__0, Ocean current energy is one of promising power resource for Japan, since Kurosio Current, which pass through near the Japanese coast, is one of strongest ocean current in the world. We formed a consortium and started to study about a floating type current turbine system last year. A floating type concept with the twin-turbine is proposed as a minimum weight ocean current generator. The float is moored by a single mooring line and the tension force is balanced with the thrust force and the buoyancy of the turbine. This system is supposed to have a weathervane function and the depth is controllable by adjusting the buoyancy and the blade pitch. A conceptual design, turbine design, current measurement at off Izu Island and a computer code to simulate the state of whole system are shown in this paper.
__label__0, THE results of the explosions made by the German Greenland Expedition to determine the thickness of the Greenland ice-cap have been awaited with much interest, owing to their widespread geographical and geological bearing. Two theories have been advanced as to the structure of Greenland. According to one theory, it is a high plateau capped with ice, and the rapid flow of the Greenland glaciers is due to their steep gradient. According to the rival view, Greenland, like Ireland, is a saucer-shaped land, consisting of a rim of mountains with the central hollow filled by ice, which flows outward over the surrounding highlands. Carvill Lewis adduced Greenland in support of the assumed covering of the Irish Sea by a dome of ice which then flowed over the Welsh mountains to the height of 1300 ft. Croll claimed that the Greenland ice was as thick as its height above sea-level, in support of his view that the ice at the south pole is 24 miles thick. Croll s estimates of the thickness of the Greenland ice-cap were declared impossible, in accordance with Lord Kelvin s calculations as to the maximum possible thickness of ice.
__label__0, In this article, we describe the autotransplantation of a supplemental premolar to replace an extracted first permanent molar in a 12-year-old boy. Although the end results are not ideal due to the small size of the donor tooth, the esthetics and function of the dental arch are partly restored using a natural tooth rather than a prosthesis. This case report illustrates the usefulness of autotransplantation as a viable treatment option in children with missing permanent teeth.
__label__0, Apologizing or praising has various effects on people's motivation levels. One way to employ emotions in computerized environments is to present humanized messages like apologetic statements. In this study, a game offering apologetic statements for a group of subjects was used to understand the effect of apologetic statements in computerized environment. Findings have shown that the apologetic feedbacks made the subjects feel more respected, more comfortable, and more sensitive to their feelings. These findings confirm the legitimacy of the claim that computers' offering apologetic statements to the users can realize the real user-centered design.
__label__0, Rapid and accurate detection of pathogens is paramount to human health. Spectroscopic techniques have been shown to be viable methods for detecting various pathogens. Enhanced methods of Raman spectroscopy can discriminate unique bacterial signatures; however, many of these require precise conditions and do not have in vivo replicability. Common biological detection methods such as rapid antigen detection tests have high specificity but do not have high sensitivity. Here we developed a new method of bacteria detection that is both highly specific and highly sensitive by combining the specificity of antibody staining and the sensitivity of spectroscopic characterization. Bacteria samples, treated with a fluorescent antibody complex specific to Streptococcus pyogenes, were volumetrically normalized according to their Raman bacterial signal intensity and characterized for fluorescence, eliciting a positive result for samples containing Streptococcus pyogenes and a negative result for those without. The normalized fluorescence intensity of the Streptococcus pyogenes gave a signal that is up to 16.4 times higher than that of other bacteria samples for bacteria stained in solution and up to 12.7 times higher in solid state. This method can be very easily replicated for other bacteria species using suitable antibody-dye complexes. In addition, this method shows viability for in vivo detection as it requires minute amounts of bacteria, low laser excitation power, and short integration times in order to achieve high signal.
__label__0, Trophoblast cells invading into decidual tissue of implantation sites of 21 cases in early stage of gestation were morphologically studied in order to clarify the correlation between integrity of the microfilament system and the various biological statuses. Especially, trophoblast cells of ovum at 15 day post coitus were mainly analyzed, since the migrating direction of the cells could be easily identified. 1. Syncytiotrophoblast cells migrating to maternal vessel were in slender shape toward the vessel. Thin and thick filaments connecting to dense body in tip of the cell run parallel with the cell axis. Thus, it is suggested that trophoblast cell migrates in decidual tissue by the joint work of its own actin and myosin in the tip of the cell. 2. Trophoblast cells making close contact with maternal cell such as endothelial cell, decidual cell and gland cell were relatively stable. The cells mainly put into action to project the cytoplasmic processes by thin filament, beneath the cytomembrane, running parallel with the cytomembrane and by thin filament, in the cytoplasmic process, running parallel with the axis of the cytoplasmic process in order to exchange information with maternal cell or to destroy the maternal cell.
__label__0, Hyperbranched polymers constitute a unique class of branched macromolecules, where structural complexity is complemented by relative ease of synthesis. The increasing interest in the study of these materials is due to their distinctive properties, inherently tied to their complex molecular architecture, and is augmented by the continual growth of applications like catalysis, viscosity modifiers, and sensors. We report a structural model for HBPs based on fractal scaling of both mass and connectivity. This model is shown to be of use in understanding small angle scattering data, especially in comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for structural characterization.
__label__0, Rock bolts have been widely used as rock reinforcing members in underground coal mine roadways and tunnels. Failures of rock bolts occur as a result of overloading, corrosion, seismic burst and bad grouting, leading to catastrophic economic and personnel losses. Monitoring the health condition of the rock bolts plays an important role in ensuring the safe operation of underground mines. This work presents a brief introduction on the types of rock bolts followed by a comprehensive review of rock bolt monitoring using smart sensors. Smart sensors that are used to assess rock bolt integrity are reviewed to provide a firm perception of the application of smart sensors for enhanced performance and reliability of rock bolts. The most widely used smart sensors for rock bolt monitoring are the piezoelectric sensors and the fiber optic sensors. The methodologies and principles of these smart sensors are reviewed from the point of view of rock bolt integrity monitoring. The applications of smart sensors in monitoring the critical status of rock bolts, such as the axial force, corrosion occurrence, grout quality and resin delamination, are highlighted. In addition, several prototypes or commercially available smart rock bolt devices are also introduced.

__label__0, UNLABELLED Recent outbreaks of avian influenza are being caused by unusually virulent H5N1 strains. It is unknown what makes these recent H5N1 strains more aggressive than previously circulating strains. Here, we have compared more than 3000 RNA sequences of segment 8 of type A influenza viruses and found a unique single nucleotide substitution typically associated with recent H5N1 strains. By phylogenetic analysis, biochemical and biophysical experiments, we demonstrate that this substitution dramatically affects the equilibrium between a hairpin and a pseudoknot conformation near the 3' splice-site of the NS gene. This conformational shift may have consequences for splicing regulation of segment 8 mRNA. Our data suggest that besides changes at the protein level, changes in RNA secondary structure should be seriously considered when attempting to explain influenza virus evolution.   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
__label__0, Building networked control systems is a promising direction that promotes the evolution of the traditional control systems. The ability of using different sampling rates in control systems provides the flexibility for adapting their resource needs based on the dynamic networking environment. This paper studies the dynamic rate adaptation problem for networked control systems. In particular, we define a utility function which quantifies the relationship between the performance of a control system and its sampling rate. Then we formulate the rate adaptation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem, where the aggregated utility is maximized. We further present a price-based algorithm, where prices are generated to reflect the network utilization penalties and are used as the basis for rate adaptation. We formally prove the stability of our algorithm. The rate adaptation algorithm is further evaluated in an integrated simulation environment that consists of Matlab and ns-2, which allows highly accurate evaluation of network effects on the NCS performance. The experiment results show that our algorithm is able to provide agile and stable sampling rate adaptation.

__label__0, Conifers, Ginkgo, cycads and gnetophytes comprise the four groups of extant gymnosperms holding a unique position of sharing common ancestry with the angiosperms. Comparative studies of gymnosperms and angiosperms are the key to a better understanding of ancient seed plant morphologies, how they have shifted over evolution to shape modern day species, and how the genes governing these morphologies have evolved. However, conifers and other gymnosperms have been notoriously difficult to study due to their long generation times, inaccessibility to genetic experimentation and unavailable genome sequences. Now, with three draft genomes from spruces and pines, rapid advances in next generation sequencing methods for genome wide expression analyses, and enhanced methods for genetic transformation, we are much better equipped to address a number of key evolutionary questions relating to seed plant evolution. In this mini-review we highlight recent progress in conifer developmental biology relevant to evo-devo questions. We discuss how genome sequence data and novel techniques might allow us to explore genetic variation and naturally occurring conifer mutants, approaches to reduce long generation times to allow for genetic studies in conifers, and other potential upcoming research avenues utilizing current and emergent techniques. Results from developmental studies of conifers and other gymnosperms in comparison to those in angiosperms will provide information to trace core molecular developmental control tool kits of ancestral seed plants, but foremost they will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of conifers and other gymnosperms in their own right.
__label__0, This paper explores user interface between user and information systems in system adoption. Acceptance of a system is defined as a function of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. There are several external variables that have an impact on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Therefore the content and interface design of every single application should be addressed accordingly to enhance users intention to use the system. The paper proposes that adding adaptive features into systems may be one of the approaches to address this phenomenon. We identified external variables including adaptive behavior impacting acceptance of mobile reservation system through three prototypes.

The purpose of our Commitment to Care Celebration was to share common experiences of caring among students, faculty, and staff to build community at a small midwestern college of nursing. The concernful practices of schooling learning teaching were the backbone of designing this caring experience. Narrative pedagogy invited stories of caring among participants in small circular groups to discover what was most important in caring for self and others. This event revealed a true caring experience for students, faculty, and staff, and supported how concernful practices engendered a community of learners.
__label__0, Sea urchins are a major component of recent marine communities where they exert a key role as grazers and benthic predators. However, their impact on past marine organisms, such as crinoids, is hard to infer in the fossil record. Analysis of bite mark frequencies on crinoid columnals and comprehensive genus-level diversity data provide unique insights into the importance of sea urchin predation through geologic time. These data show that over the Mesozoic, predation intensity on crinoids, as measured by bite mark frequencies on columnals, changed in step with diversity of sea urchins. Moreover, Mesozoic diversity changes in the predatory sea urchins show a positive correlation with diversity of motile crinoids and a negative correlation with diversity of sessile crinoids, consistent with a crinoid motility representing an effective escape strategy. We contend that the Mesozoic diversity history of crinoids likely represents a macroevolutionary response to changes in sea urchin predation pressure and that it may have set the stage for the recent pattern of crinoid diversity in which motile forms greatly predominate and sessile forms are restricted to deep-water refugia.

__label__0, Steganography is the science of embedding the secret messages inside other medium files in a way that hides the existence of the secret message at all. Steganography can be applied to text, audio, image, and video file types. In this study, we propose a new steganography approach for digital images in which the RGB coloring model was used. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been tested and evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed approach produce high-quality stego images that resist against visual and statistical attacks.
__label__0, The security of a network configuration is based not just on the security of its individual components and their direct interconnections, but also on the potential for systems to interoperate indirectly across network routes. Such interoperation has been shown to provide the potential for cascading paths that violate security, in a circuitous manner, across a network. In this paper we show how constraint satisfaction provides a natural approach to expressing the necessary constraints to ensure multilevel security across a network configuration. In particular, soft constraints are used to detect and eliminate the cascading network paths that compromise security. Taking this approach results in practical advancements over existing solutions to this problem. In particular, constraint satisfaction highlights the set of all cascading paths, which we can eliminate in polynomial time by breaking a minimal number of system links to ensure security.
__label__0, This paper presents a new customer classification algorithm for electronic customer relationship management. First, based on consumer characteristics and behaviors analysis, 21 customer classification indicators are designed, including customer characteristics type variables and customer behaviors type variables. Then, when considering the advantages of high classification accuracy of BP neural network model, and in order to speed up the convergence of the model, the paper constructs a new Legendre wavelets neural network model to classify customer for electronic customer relationship management. Finally the experimental results verify not only the problem of convergence speed has been solved, but also the simplicity of the model structure and the accuracy of the transformation are ensured when the new algorithm are used in electronic customer relationship management practically.
__label__0, We explore heterogeneity in the formation of new ventures within regions using agent-based simulation methodology. The study draws on entrepreneurial knowledge and action literature to examine the roles of knowledge acquisition and transformation in regional sustainability of new venture formation. A model of new venture growth pitted against incumbent firm innovation is tested on configurations of regional knowledge landscapes. Results of this analysis suggest that competing entrepreneurship perspectives of knowledge spillover and network-based new venture formation coexist and even interact. Formal knowledge acquisition and knowledge arbitrage are more effective formation mechanisms in knowledge-scarce regions, while informal knowledge acquisition and serendipity produce the highest levels of new venture formation in knowledge-rich regions. New ventures with smaller networks tend to exhibit higher likelihood of formation than those with larger networks. Formal knowledge acquisition and arbitrage not only improve survival early in the evolution of regions, but also create the basis for informal, serendipitous knowledge appropriation's superior influence on sustainable entrepreneurship. These results provide a platform for future research regarding theoretical perspectives on new venture formation, suggest growth strategies to entrepreneurs, and offer guidance to policymakers and economic development professionals who strive to increase the entrepreneurial activity of their regions or countries.

__label__0, Finding and designing new methods for determining type and exact location of faults in power system has been a major subject for power system protection engineers in recent years. Fault locating in transmission networks is not very hard and complicated due to low impedance of faults. This job is usually done by distance relays. But, in distribution networks, because of high impedance of fault and its vast variety and also simplicity of protective devices, determining the exact location of faults is very complicated. On the other hand, penetration of distribution generation into distribution networks reinforces the necessity of designing new protection systems for these networks. One of the main capabilities that can improve the efficiency of new protection relays in distribution systems is exact fault locating. In this paper, a new approach for determining the exact fault type and location in distribution systems including distributed generation using MLP neural networks is presented. In the suggested method, after determining the fault type, by normalizing the fault current of the main source, the corresponding trained neural network has been activated and the exact location of occurred fault has been derived. The presented method has been implemented on a sample distribution network, simulated by DIgSILENT Power Factory 13.2, and its performance has been tested. The simulation results show high performance and accuracy of the method and substantiate that it can be used in modern heuristic protection schemes in distribution systems.
__label__0, This contribution is devoted to computer algebra based algorithms for the analysis of systems of implicit ordinary differential equations. These systems are identified with submani-folds in a suitable jet space. It is outlined how the accessibility and observability test for implicit ordinary differential equations can be solved via an approach utilizing transformation groups, which has been already published. Since this approach requires systems in formally integrable form, an algorithm for the derivation of this form is presented and it is shown, how Groebner bases can be successfully applied in the case of implicit systems with polynomial nonlinearities. In addition, the algorithms for the tests on observability and accessibility according to the proposed approach are sketched.

__label__0, This paper examines the dynamic dependence structure between US and four developed stock markets, namely, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany and France during a recent period including the global financial crisis 2007-2009. The econometric approach is based on the extreme-value time-varying copula functions. Specifically, the marginal distributions are reproduced by an extreme-value based model, while the joint distribution is explored using the time-varying Normal and Symmarized Joe Clayton copulas. The empirical results show that the dynamic dependence between US and Japanese stock markets is symmetric, while that between US and European stock markets is asymmetric. In particular, this dynamic dependence increases during a crisis and seems to be related to the geographic position.
__label__0, Several hundred peer-reviewed studies in the past 20 years have shown that the relaxation response and mind-body interventions are clinically effective in the treatment of many health problems that are caused or made worse by stress. Recent studies show that mind-body interventions may improve prognosis in coronary heart disease and can enhance immune functioning. It is hypothesized that mind-body interventions reduce sympathetic nervous system activation and increase parasympathetic nervous system activity, and thereby restore homeostasis. Researchers have also concluded that cognitive therapy is as effective, and possibly more effective than antidepressant medication in the treatment of major depression. This report provides an overview of some studies that have shown a beneficial role of the relaxation response and cognitive restructuring in the treatment of headaches, insomnia, and cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date suggest that mind-body interventions are effective and can also provide cost savings in patient treatment. It is also clear, however, that mind-body therapies are not panaceas, and should be used in conjunction with standard medical care.

__label__0, Persons with disabilities have severe problems participating in the job market and their unemployment rate is usually much higher than the average of the population. This motivates the research of new modes of production which allow to include these persons at a low overhead. In this paper we study the inclusion of persons with disabilities into flow shops with the objective of minimizing the makespan. Since flow shops usually have only a few machines, we focus on the inclusion of one and two workers. We define the problem, propose mathematical models and a heuristic solution, as well as realistic test instances. In computational tests we evaluate the performance of the models and the heuristic, and assess the utility of such a model of inclusion. We conclude that the problem can be solved satisfactorily, and that including workers with disabilities into flow shops is economically feasible.

__label__0, In this paper we present a system which learns to recognize objects through interaction by exploiting the principle of sensorimotor coordination. The system uses a learning architecture which is composed of reactive and deliberative layers. The reactive layer consists of a database of behaviors that aremodulated to produce a desired behavior. In this work we have implemented and installed in our architecture an object manipulation behavior inspired by the concept that infants learn about their environment through manipulation. While manipulating objects, both proprioceptive data and exteroceptive data are recorded. Both of these types of data are combined and statistically analyzed in order to extract important parameters that distinctively describe the object being manipulated. This data is then clustered using the standard k-means algorithm and the resulting clusters are labeled. The labeling is used to train a radial basis function network for classifying the clusters. The performance of the system has been tested on a kinematically complex walking robot capable of manipulating objects with two legs used as arms, and it has been found that the trained neural network is able to classify objects even when only partial sensory data is available to the system. Our preliminary results demonstrate that this method can be effectively used in a robotic system which learns from experience about its environment.

It is argued that the goal-oriented nature of the newer method leads to programs which are more easily proved using Hoare-type rules. Several new examples are given to illustrate Dromey's method and to demonstrate its advantages over the top-down refinement method with regard to verifiability of the resulting programs.

Results indicate user preferences and provide many practical examples of utilizing the scenarios. Furthermore, the results are summarised to provide practical guidelines for the creation of context-aware communication applications.

In this research, we have designed and implemented a Peer-to-Peer network simulator to efficiently serve multimedia on the Internet considering that P2P streaming applications scale very superior even in large crowd scenarios. Simulated data was used to conduct experiment from current popular multimedia serving websites such as YouTube. We have then simulated user traffic by using the P2P system to compare the performance result with the traditional Client-Server system.

The context of the study was the in the Psychiatric Community Services in the greater Johannesburg region, South Africa. Individual and focus group interviews were conducted with patients and mental health clinicians representing the multidisciplinary team with experience in managing the condition, either in a personal capacity or as professional mental health practitioners. Themes extrapolated from the transcribed interviews were further explored and a practice-based theory was constructed. This article reports on the first theme 'Trust', the concept identified by both patients and clinicians as crucial for the establishment and maintenance of the therapeutic relationship that forms the vehicle for care of patients with this disorder in psychiatric mental health care.

__label__0, project development has always been associated with high failure rate. The failure of a software project depends on rooted risks. These risks don't come into face at early stages of requirement gathering and analysis which carried on in the further phases of development greatly affects the cost of a software project. Researchers consider requirements uncertainty and risk as a problem to be addressed during the early stages of software development. It is a well known fact that it is more feasible to make changes to the software system under development in the early stages of the software development cycle. However, there are a very few techniques available for assessing risk at the requirements level and those that are available are highly subjective and are not based on any formal design models. In this paper, a method has been proposed to implement inspection technique for identifying the key requirement risk factors responsible in achieving successful outcome and use a Bayesian network approach to establish a model for predicting the risks that leads to fail a software projects.

__label__0, Reflex stiffness is often modeled as a Hammerstein system comprising a cascade of a static nonlinear element and a linear dynamic element. The nonlinearity is frequently modeled as a half wave rectifier so that changes in the reflex response can only be modeled by changes in the parameters of the linear element. This is an oversimplification since there are physiological mechanisms that could change both the threshold of the nonlinearity and the linear dynamics. This study explores the ability of a new subspace identification algorithm to distinguish changes in parameters of the nonlinear element from those of the linear element. Simulation studies demonstrate that the method does so very effectively even in the presence of substantial output noise. Pilot experiments in which the method was applied to stretch reflex EMG data revealed that both the threshold of the nonlinearity and the gain of the linear element change with muscle activation.
__label__0, The development of data intensive problems in recent years has brought new requirements and challenges to storage and computing infrastructures. Researchers are not only doing batch loading and processing of large scale of data, but also demanding the capabilities of incremental updates and interactive analysis. Therefore, extending existing storage systems to handle these new requirements becomes an important research challenge. This paper presents our efforts on IndexedHBase, a scalable, faulttolerant, and indexed NoSQL table storage system that can satisfy these emerging requirement in an integrated way. IndexedHBase is an extension of the cloud storage system HBase. Modeled after Google's BigTable, HBase supports reliable storage and efficient access to terabytes or even petabytes of structured data. However, it does not have an inherent mechanism for searching field values, especially full-text field values. IndexedHBase solves this issue by adding support for an inverted index to HBase, and storing the index data with HBase tables. Leveraging the distributed architecture of HBase, IndexedHBase can achieve reliable index data storage, fast real-time data updating and indexing, as well as efficient parallel data analysis using Hadoop MapReduce. Exploiting the inverted index, IndexedHBase employs three different searching strategies to support interactive data analysis. In order to evaluate IndexedHBase in large scale HPC systems, we extend the MyHadoop framework and provide MyHBase, which can dynamically build a one-click HBase deployment in an HPC job, and automatically finish related tasks. We test the performance of IndexedHBase with the ClueWeb09 Category B data set on 101 nodes of the Quarry HPC cluster at Indiana University. The performance results show that IndexedHBase not only satisfies the requirements for fast incremental data updating, but also supports efficient large scale batch processing over both text and index data. Moreover, by intelligently selecting suitable strategies, searching performance for interactive analysis can be improved by one to two orders of magnitude.
__label__0, Alpha-band rhythm is thought to be involved in memory processes, similarly to other spontaneous brain rhythms. Ten right-handed healthy volunteers participated in our proposed sequential short-term memory task that provides a serial position effect in accuracy rate. We recorded alpha-band rhythms by magnetoencephalography during performance of the task and observed that the amplitude of the rhythm was suppressed dramatically in the memory recall period. The suppressed region was estimated to be in the occipital lobe, suggesting that alpha-band rhythm is suppressed by activation of the occipital attentional network. Additionally, the alpha-band suppression reflected accuracy rate, that is, the amplitude was suppressed more when recalling items with higher accuracy rate. The sensors with a significant correlation between alpha-band amplitude and accuracy rate were located widely from the frontal to occipital regions mainly in the right hemisphere. The results suggests that alpha-band rhythm is involved in memory recall and can be index of memory performance.
__label__0, This paper presents a new rate based call gapping method. The main advantage is that it provides maximal throughput, priority handling and fairness for traffic classes without queues, unlike Token Bucket which provides only the first two or Weighted Fair Queuing that uses queues. The Token Bucket is used for call gapping because it has good throughput characteristics. For this reason we present a mixture of the two methods keeping the good properties of both. A mathematical model has been developed to support our proposal. It defines the three requirements and proves theorems about if they are satisfied with the different call gapping mechanisms. Simulation, numerical results and statistical discussion are also presented to underpin the findings.

Simulation and test all prove that the algorithm is available.
__label__0, The most abused drug in our country and the world over for that matter is alcohol. Though legal, it causes more pain and death than any of the drugs if abuse. It is precisely because alcohol is legal and accepted in our society that it is so easy to abuse. Its availability and the highs that it brings make it tempting for young people to get into. Once hooked, they can go on drinking openly for a lifetime. Unless they get into trouble with the law, they can drink themselves to death and do so legally. Drug addicts get arrested while alcoholics can stagger past policemen without being bothered.
__label__0, Current interactive surfaces provide little or no information about which fingers are touching the surface, the amount of pressure exerted, or gestures that occur when not in contact with the surface. These limitations constrain the interaction vocabulary available to interactive surface systems. In our work, we extend the surface interaction space by using muscle sensing to provide complementary information about finger movement and posture. In this paper, we describe a novel system that combines muscle sensing with a multi-touch tabletop, and introduce a series of new interaction techniques enabled by this combination. We present observations from an initial system evaluation and discuss the limitations and challenges of utilizing muscle sensing for tabletop applications.
__label__0, The economics literature has traditionally argued that competition negatively affects incentives to establish long-term, cooperative relationships. We provide a model to illustrate that the opposite result may hold in relationships where both parties must make up-front, non-contractible investments, a situation that often characterizes the establishment of surplus-increasing relationships. We provide evidence for this hypothesis in the context of the establishment of trade credit relationships, using data on the supply relationships of firms in five African countries. Because the data include several observations per firm, we are able to utilize firm fixed-effects, thus netting out unobserved firm characteristics that may have been
__label__0, This study analyzed and compared the survey responses of teenagers who smoke different cigarette brands. It was found that teen Marlboro and Camel smokers perceived themselves as having more stress in their lives as compared with teen Newport smokers. On average, Marlboro smokers were depressed or sad more often than were Camel or Newport smokers. Camel smokers were generally less interested in a peer stop-smoking program than were Newport or Marlboro smokers. Finally, these teen smokers, regardless of cigarette brand, had similar opinions about quitting. Given the differences across brands, more flexible approaches may be needed to address teenage smoking.
__label__0, The pressure drop along the glottal constriction drives vocal folds self-sustained oscillations during phonation. Physical modeling of phonation is classically assessed with the glottal geometry and the subglottal pressure as known input parameters. Several studies including in-vitro validation show that simplified one-dimensional flow models allow predictions of the flow characteristics to a fair extent. Application of physical modeling to study phonation abnormalities and pathologies requires input parameters which can be related to in-vivo measurable quantities commonly corresponding to the physical model output parameters. The current paper considers the inversion of some popular simplified flow models in order to estimate the subglottal pressure, the glottal constriction area or the flow model parameters under unsteady flow conditions. The theoretical predictions are tested against in-vitro measurements.
__label__0, In 1891 a paper by Georg Cantor was published in which he addressed the relative cardinality of two sets, the set of integers and the set of real numbers, in effort to demonstrate that the two sets were of unequal cardinality. This paper offers a contrary conclusion to Cantor's argument, together with implication of such to the theory of computation.
__label__0, Reliable, durable, and scalable fabrication of garment-integrated electronics are the major barriers to larger-scale garment integrated applications for wearable technology. This research emphasizes developing hybrid manufacturing processes leveraging the benefits of the traditional labor-intensive apparel industry and the automated electronics industry. The proposed manufacturing process uses the existing technology, resources, and operation sequence of a typical apparel manufacturing facility. A simulation approach is utilized to increase the overall efficiency of the manufacturing method.
__label__0, Providing medical care is us a complex process that requires a strict respect for human rights. In countries like Peru, despite of having regulations and specific laws, patient's autonomy is not a common currency and certainly paternalism and beneficence generally overrule in physicians decision making. In this type of reality the requirement to health care professionals for respecting fundamental rights should be considered crucial, far more than in societies where citizens are really empowered. But to achieve the full respect of human rights, especially when providing a health care service, there is the need to go much further than just advocating for appropriate legislation and regulatory frameworks. In this article I argue that the violation of certain rights as the informed consent process by health care providers, is rooted in how these professionals, specially medical doctors trained in the western tradition, establish priorities and arrive to moral judgments. In this scenario I consider the need of a change in the way the Human Rights framework is being used to improve fundamental rights respect in health care.

__label__0, This document outlines doctoral research being undertaken by Reid Kerr, under the supervision of Robin Cohen. In this research, we are investigating the problem of detecting and identifying groups of agents that are collaborating, within a larger population. In the scenarios with which we are primarily concerned, agents may cooperate to further their own interests, despite the fact that this may be unwelcome or forbidden. Colluding agents, then, are unlikely to advertise their membership in a team, and may actively seek to conceal their cooperation. We address the problem of identifying such coalitions and their activities.
__label__0, Ontologies, as sets of concepts and their interrelations in a specific domain, have proven to be a useful tool in the areas of digital libraries, semantic web, and the like. But large-scale analysis of ontology usage is constrained primarily in specific domain, like medical, scholarly artifact, biosciences, where knowledge presentation is structured and easier to understand. The application of ontologies in the domain of humanities, especially history, however, is rare since the extraction from knowledge of history is hard. In the current paper, we introduce an ontology based visualization model to integrate ontology in historical knowledge searching. Particularly, this period of history is related with Kuomintang and Early Communist Periods of China. The objective is assisting knowledge representation and knowledge inference for the purpose of knowledge management.
__label__0, This paper, based on fieldwork among agrarian reform beneficiaries in the Dominican Republic, examines the utilization of health care. Specific attention is given to the consumption of private medical care and its relationship to changes in the system of land tenure, policy in the agrarian reform, and the roles of physicians. A principal concern of the paper is the examination of the adaptive strategies of beneficiaries of the reform in light of political and economic influences. A second concern is the consideration of the integration of critical medical anthropology's perspectives on the political economy with a perspective on decision-making and adaptive strategies.

__label__0, CAO is a chronic, degenerative disease of the lung that produces a number of serious physiologic abnormalities in respiratory function. It is progressive and, in general, responds poorly to medical therapy. Cigarette smoking is almost universally the cause of the disease, and stopping smoking clearly slows the progress of the disorder. Therapy is of marginal value at best in a substantial number of patients with this problem, and even in those who respond well, improvement in function is not great. A conservative approach to therapy is advised, but only when its value can be documented. As the illness progresses, chronic oxygen therapy in hypoxic patients may be of value in preventing or treating cor pulmonale.

Smith\n\n# Abstract\n\nOur study measured heterotrophic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in a drained peatland under potato cultivation in south-western Uganda. Soil carbon losses have not previously been reported for this land use, and our study set out to capture the range and temporal variation in emissions, as well as investigate relationships with key environmental variables. Soil chamber-based emission measurements were taken over five days at four points in time over the year to capture daily and monthly variability, including day and night sampling to capture any diurnal variations in temperatures and soil flux. Differences in soil microtopography from mounding of soils for potato beds and drainage trenches had a significant effect on the rate of soil flux. Diurnal sampling showed no significant difference in emissions or soil temperatures in the raised potato beds between day and night. More significant effects on soil flux from environmental drivers, such as water table depth, were observed between months, rather than hours and days. There were significant differences in the relationships between environmental variables and soil flux, depending on if soils had been recently disturbed or not. Area-weighted emissions based on microtopography gave a mean annual emissions factor of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 standard error) from this peatland use.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nGlobally, peatlands cover approximately 420 million ha, equivalent to 2.8% of the world land area. Of this area, approximately 44-170 million ha are found in the tropics, with an estimated tropical peatland carbon (C) pool of 81.7-91.9 Gt C. The C rich soils in peatlands are formed from long-term accumulation of dead plant material, preserved under anaerobic conditions due to high water table levels. Land use change in peatlands results in significant C losses to the atmosphere, principally due to drainage leading to microbial decomposition of the soil C, aquatic export of dissolved and particulate organic C, and methane emissions from drainage channels. Of the total area of tropical peatlands, it is estimated that approximately 24.2 Mha are degraded, with a loss of 1.48 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> per year.\n\nWhile the Congo Basin in central Africa has the most extensive peatland complex on the continent [and the most extensive in the tropics], neighbouring Uganda is the largest contributor to emissions from degrading peat in Africa, where at least 0.5 Mha of Uganda\u2019s estimated 1.3 Mha of peatland has been degraded, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of up to 20 Mt yr<sup>-1</sup>. However, there is limited research into the use of peat soils in Uganda, and the impacts of peatland degradation on soil C and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics.\n\nAcross Uganda wetland types vary, and can be found fringing lakes, in lowland plains and in valley bottoms. Vegetation found in these wetlands are diverse and include grassland, *Cyperus papyrus*, woodlands, and palms, with plants either anchored into the soil or floating on the water\u2019s surface. These wetland areas are where Uganda\u2019s peat soils are found. While the extent of peat soils across the country is still to be fully documented, they are often found underpinning papyrus-dominated wetland areas, in particular in the SW of the country. The valley bottom wetlands of the Kigezi highlands close to the border with Rwanda have some of the deepest reported peat deposits of all of Uganda, but the most widespread wetland drainage and land use change occurs here as well. Wetland conversion is largely due to agricultural drivers, with cultivation of potatoes on these peat soils estimated to provide income of US$ 3,000 \u00b1 1,000 ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> to smallholder farmers.\n\nWhile the key environmental drivers affecting GHG emissions from soils have been documented in many studies and indicate strong relationships between temperature, water table depth (WTD) and soil respiration flux, there is limited understanding of these relationships for the diversity of conditions found across tropical peatlands. It is important to highlight the need to differentiate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from heterotrophic respiration during microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (R<sub>h</sub>) and the emissions from roots and autotrophs which is not a result of soil carbon loss, The majority of tropical peatland emissions research has been conducted in SE Asia, and to a lesser extent in the Amazon basin, but there are considerable gaps when it comes to understanding the range and biogeochemistry of C losses experienced by these drained peatlands under the diversity of land use changes and wetland conditions occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. At an ecosystem level the work of Saunders et\u00a0al. identified reductions in ecosystem C due to agricultural conversion in wetlands in Uganda based on measurements of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, but how much soils contribute to overall carbon loss from these systems is unknown.\n\nFor these reasons, this study set out to understand the biogeochemistry and rates of C losses from peat soils under land use change, through measurement of heterotrophic CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from a potato cultivated peatland in a deep peat wetland system in SW Uganda. The key objectives of this were to quantify the potential range of soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes associated with this land use change on this soil, identify if there is temporal variability in these CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, and identify any relationships between soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and key environmental variables.\n\n# 2 Methods\n\nThis study was implemented in the catchment of the Ruhuma wetland system in Muko Sub-county, Kabale District, in the Kigezi Highlands of south western Uganda (-1.208752\u00b0 latitude, 29.830968\u00b0 longitude, approximately 1,900 m above sea level). The landscape comprises of steep mineral soil hillsides which slope into a minerotrophic wetland valley bottom. The entire landscape is a mosaic of small, privately cultivated plots, with those in the wetland managed under farmer cooperatives, and individual plots distributed between farmers, most of whom manage multiple plots.\n\nThe Ruhuma wetland system is part of a network of peat dominated, valley bottom wetlands in the area, located 35\u00a0km SW of Kabale town, where the river Ruhuma flows north out of Lake Bunyonyi. The wetland covers approximately 5.47 km<sup>2</sup>, at an altitude of 1,930 m above sea level. Wetland edge cultivation began in the 1980s and by the late 1990s the majority of the wetland was drained and converted for cultivation (personal communication). Peat depths in this wetland are significant, with measurements in the site indicating depths of over 10\u00a0m (personal data), and other studies measuring peat depths of over 20\u00a0m in neighbouring wetlands. The sapric peat soils found in this wetland are highly organic, with average organic matter contents measured at 87.22 \u00b1 3.9% [\u00b1 SD, n=198] and bulk densities averaging 0.125 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0g cm<sup>3</sup> [\u00b1 SD, n=835].\n\nIn order to determine the range and temporal variability in fluxes from peat soils under potato cultivation we measured CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at daily, weekly and monthly timesteps. To capture the weekly and monthly variability, we conducted four sets of repeated 5-day morning (between 9.00 and 11.00) and afternoon (between 15.00 and 17.00) measurements on thirty randomly located paired collars (15 on raised beds and 15 on adjacent trenches) within a potato field. In addition to this, on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of each sampling period we added sampling at 18.00, 21.00 and 24.00, and 5.00 and 12.00 the following day, with the intention of capturing diurnal variability in temperatures and emissions. In order to determine the relationships between soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and key environmental variables, soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, soil and air temperatures, WTD were all recorded *in situ* from each collar for every measurement. Measurements were all conducted from within the same farmer\u2019s field in an area under management by the Rurigita Farmer\u2019s Cooperative of the Ruhuma wetland.\n\nWhen preparing the experimental design we were limited by the lack of available land use information, in particular around how the soils were used over the year. We targeted our sampling campaigns as best as possible towards capturing the potential difference in environmental and management conditions that the soils would experience over the year. Measurements were taken at the end of the rainy season in May 2014 when wetland soils were dug in preparation for planting of potatoes, in the dry season in August 2014 during the potato growing season, in the rainy season in November 2014 after the harvest at the start of the fallow period, and in February 2015 during the dry season and fallow period prior to the next season of planting. Farmers digging of the potato beds in May involved the clearing of fallow weeds into the old trenches between old, raised beds, and then piling the soil from the previous year\u2019s beds into these trenches. Once the old bed had been transferred into the old trench, further digging down into fresher peat brought up previously unexposed soil which was piled on top of the new beds. After approximately 48 hours these new beds were planted with rows of potatoes. Potatoes grew for approximately 3.5 months, when they were harvested for market with the onset of the new rainy season in September. After harvesting, beds were left fallow until the following June, when the cycle of mining and mounding fresh peat to create new beds was repeated."} 
{"question": "What factors contributed to the significant difference in soil CO2 flux between raised beds and trenches?", "answer": "The significant difference in soil CO2 flux between raised beds and trenches can be attributed to micro-topographical differences, as raised beds had a mean heterotrophic respiration (R_h) emission of 1.39 \u00b1 0.6 g m^-2 hr^-1, while trenches had a mean of 0.22 \u00b1 0.1 g m^-2 hr^-1. Additionally, environmental variables such as soil and air temperature, water table depth (WTD), and time of day influenced the flux measurements, with raised beds showing higher R_h emissions during night-time compared to daytime, whereas trenches showed lower emissions at night.", "context": "Collars made from PVC piping 10\u00a0cm in diameter and 5\u00a0cm in height were fully inserted into the soil. Care was taken to place collars away from any plants and they were checked on removal at the end of each sampling period to ensure no plant roots were present. These collars remained *in situ* for each 5-day set of samples and were then removed and randomly placed for the next month\u2019s sampling. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were sampled using a PP Systems EGM-4 with a SRC-1 Soil Respiration Chamber placed onto the collars. Chamber measurements were set to run for up to 120 seconds. The WTD was recorded using a tape-measure and pre-prepared dip-well near to each pair of collars, and soil and air temperature were recorded during each flux measurement using digital thermometers with a 0.1\u00b0C resolution.\n\nAll data analysis was conducted in R Studio v 1.4.1106 using R v 4.0.4.\u00a0A linear function was applied to the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> recorded for each measurement and data was then converted into flux based on the following equation:\n\n$$\n{R}_h=(S\\times (\\frac{P}{1000})\\times (\\frac{273}{273+T})\\times (\\frac{40.01}{22.41})\\times (\\frac{V}{A}))/1000\\times 3600 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere *R*<sub>h</sub> was the rate of efflux (g m<sup>-2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>), *S* was the slope of the concentration increase during the measurement (ppm s<sup>-1</sup>), *P* was the pressure in the chamber (mBar, recorded by the EGM), *T* was the soil temperature (\u00b0C), *V* was the chamber volume (0.001171 m<sup>3</sup>), and *A* was the collar area (0.0078 m<sup>2</sup>). The ratio $\\frac{40.01}{22.41}$ accounts for the area occupied by one kg mol of CO<sub>2</sub> at standard temperature and pressure. Division by 1,000 and multiplication by 3,600 converts kg to g and seconds to hours.\n\nMean results are presented with either standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), as noted in the results. T-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare results, along with Tukey\u2019s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Linear models were developed based on log transformed R<sub>h</sub>. We explored a series of linear models for R<sub>h</sub> and WTD, soil temperature and soil management (raised beds, trenches and recent disturbance). Regression models were further improved with the log transformation of the R<sub>h</sub>.\n\n# 3 Results\n\nOver 1,300 soil flux measurements were taken as part of this study. We observed a significant difference in the rate of soil flux from the raised beds (referred to as raised beds, n=648), compared to the narrow drainage trenches between them (referred to as trenches, n=653, t-test, p<0.005, **Table\u00a01**), and as such all results are split based on this micro-topographical difference.

Day time air temperatures (taken in day light hours; i.e. between 7.00 and 19.00) ranged between a minimum of 14 \u00b0C to a maximum of 34\u00a0\u00b0C, compared to night time measurements which were limited to 10-17 \u00b0C. Across all measurements the minimum soil temperature was 16.2 \u00b0C and the maximum 23.7 \u00b0C. Soil temperatures did not show such a change between day to night conditions, with almost identical mean temperatures reported for daytime and night-time results per micro-topographical class (**Table\u00a01**). Mean R<sub>h</sub> was higher in the night than in the day from the raised beds, whereas from the trenches it was lower. Measured WTDs varied between 21\u00a0cm and 81\u00a0cm below the soil surface of the raised beds, and between 2\u00a0cm above and 52\u00a0cm below the soil surface of the trenches.\n\n## 3.2 Temporal Variability\n\n### 3.2.1 Daily\n\nAcross the entire dataset, separated for raised beds and trenches, we found that there was no significant difference in the R<sub>h</sub> measured from the raised beds between the sampling times of day (ANOVA, p=0.27, **Figure\u00a01**). In the trenches a significant difference in R<sub>h</sub> was found between morning and midnight measurements and the morning and measurements taken in the 15.00 to 17.00 time period (ANOVA, Tukey\u2019s HSD, p<0.005). Soil temperature on the raised beds and in the trenches was significantly different between the measurements earlier in the day (the morning and early afternoon measurements from 5.00 \u2013 14.00) compared with the higher later afternoon and night-time measurements (15.00 \u2013 1.00), potentially due to a lag time from daytime sun (p<0.001).\n\nAir temperature showed a significant reduction in temperature over the night-time sampling points (p<0.001).\n\n### 3.2.2 Day to Day\n\nUsing the regularly sampled morning and afternoon datasets, there was a significant difference between the means of some results when compared between the 5 days of sampling, with data grouped based on microtopography, month, and time of day that measurements were taken (ANOVA, with significance determined based on p value <0.05, using the regular morning and afternoon measurements, **Table\u00a02**). Soil and air temperature were the most frequently different variables between days. The WTD only varied significantly between days in November and February. There were no significant differences in the day-to-day R<sub>h</sub> measurements on raised beds, and only in the trenches in November and February, corresponding to the period of variation in the WTD.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a02: Occasions when there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in flux results across the 5 day measurement period per month, split for raised beds and trenches, and split into morning and afternoon measurements.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Month & Number of measurement days & AM soil temperature & PM soil temperature & AM air temperature & PM air temperature & AM water table depth & PM water table depth & AM R<sub>h</sub> measurements & PM R<sub>h</sub> measurements \\\\\n \\midrule\n Raised beds & May 2014 & 5 & * & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & August 2014 & 5 & & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & November 2014 & 5 & * & * & * & * & * & * & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & February 2015 & 5 (AM), 3 (PM) & * & * & & * & * & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n Trenches & May 2014 & 5 & * & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & August 2014 & 5 & & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & November 2014 & 5 & * & * & * & * & * & & * & * \\\\\n \\hline\n & February 2015 & 5 (AM), 3 (PM) & * & * & & * & * & * & * & \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T2}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n### 3.2.3 Month to Month\n\nMeasured environmental variables and R<sub>h</sub> varied significantly over the year between sampling occasions (p<0.05),; this allowed us to examine the difference between results from raised beds and the trenches using the regularly sampled morning and afternoon data (**Tables\u00a03**, **4**). Comparison between the four months found there were significant differences between most variables measured. In all months except November-May and November-August the WTD was significantly different between months in the raised beds, and across all months there was a significant difference between months in the WTD in the trenches.

Disturbance was due to digging of the peat for preparation of the raised beds (in May 2014), and from the potato harvest prior to flux sampling in November. At the undisturbed sampling times we saw a significant relationship between the WTD and R<sub>h</sub> (p<0.001, adjusted r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.77) and a strong relationship between the soil temperature and R<sub>h</sub> although with high variability (p<0.001, adjusted r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.07). For the measurements taken when the soil in the raised beds had been recently disturbed these relationships were no longer significant (p>0.3, adjusted r<sup>2 =</sup> 0, **Figure\u00a02**).\n\nThe log transformation of the R<sub>h</sub> further strengthened our regression models.

Soil temperature also showed a significant relationship (linear model, p<0.001, **Table\u00a05** equation (b)), but had a lower proportion of the total variance explained by the model (adjusted r<sup>2</sup> of 0.23).

Taking into account the size of the study field, this is equivalent to 77 \u00b1 4% (\u00b1 SE) under raised beds and 23 \u00b1 0.3% (\u00b1 SE) under trenches. Taking the mean from all R<sub>h</sub> measurements, 1.397 \u00b1 0.02\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SE) from the raised beds and 0.225 \u00b1 0.005\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SE) from the trenches and area-weighing them based on the measured field dimensions provides a mean hourly emissions rate of 1.128 \u00b1 0.019\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>, equivalent to a mean annual emissions rate of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SE). While this annual loss estimate is simply based on the means of our measurements, future studies can refine this value through capturing further detail on environmental variables and soil use over the year.\n\n# 4 Discussion\n\n## 4.1 Range\n\nThe peat soils in this study site were a strong contributor to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Due to the mounding of soil to make the raised beds, the raised beds had a thicker layer of soil above the WTD than the trenches and thus showed significantly different rates of soil C loss with area weighed emissions from raised beds on average 10 times higher than from trenches per hectare across each month. While the mean hourly rate of R<sub>h</sub> from the trenches were nearly an order of magnitude lower than on the raised beds, they were still significant and comparable with those from other studies when considering a similar concept to the commonly applied micro-topographical classification of hummocks and hollows in peatland soils research. Jauhiainen et\u00a0al., 2005 presented a range of hollow flux measurements between 0.1-0.9\u00a0g m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> from a tropical forest floor with WTD of 0 to -30\u00a0cm, of which our average monthly range in R<sub>h</sub> from the trenches sits at the lower end of, between 0.16 to 0.27\u00a0g m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> with a WTD of -9 to -28\u00a0cm.\n\nComparison with other literature from the African continent is difficult due to a lack of heterotrophic emissions studies on cultivated peat soils. Were et\u00a0al. reported CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from an intact, waterlogged wetland in eastern Uganda, with mean CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes reported to be between 2.4-2.5\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> across different wetland vegetation types. This rate of flux is higher than we measured, but is assumed to include autotrophic respiration which our study does not. Carbon dioxide emissions from a cultivated Kenyan wetland (although not strictly R<sub>h</sub> as cut stems and roots were still present in collars) reported an approximate maximum of 0.3\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> which was at the lower end of our measured emissions, but was not on peat soils (organic carbon content < 5%).\n\n## 4.2 Temporal Variability"} 
{"question": "What factors contribute to the high carbon emissions from peat soils under potato cultivation in Uganda?", "answer": "The high carbon emissions from peat soils under potato cultivation in Uganda are primarily due to the management practices that involve the annual disturbance of soils. This includes the mounding of fresh peat to create raised beds, which exposes previously waterlogged soils to aerobic conditions, leading to increased emissions. Additionally, the lack of significant diurnal variability in soil temperature and R<sub>h</sub> suggests that soil management practices, rather than temperature fluctuations, are the main drivers of emissions. The study found that the raised beds had emissions nearly an order of magnitude higher than the trenches, indicating that the microtopography and soil disturbance from planting and harvesting significantly impact the rate of R<sub>h</sub>.", "context": "While we observed a significant reduction in air temperature overnight, this was not reflected in the soil temperatures, which showed an increase in temperature into the night with any early morning cooling of the soils still within the range of daytime soil temperatures. The R<sub>h</sub> also exhibited little to no difference over the day and night-time measurements- indicating that variability in R<sub>h</sub> over a diurnal time frame is not a significant consideration in this site. This is likely to be due to no changes in WTD overnight (the variable that exhibited the strongest influence on emissions), and no soil cooling overnight (in fact a mean 0.4\u00b0C increase in nocturnal soil temperatures in both the raised beds and trenches across all measurements). This contrasts with other studies that describe higher soil temperatures and R<sub>h</sub> during the middle of the day. Other studies have observed lower diurnal temperatures compared to daytime measurements, and applied correction factors to adjust daytime flux measurements based on Q<sub>10</sub>. Instead, we saw a much stronger difference in the month-to-month observations, in both the measured environmental variables and the R<sub>h</sub>.\n\nThere are no comparative R<sub>h</sub> studies for drained peat soils within Uganda, and so comparison of our estimated annual emissions from these soils can only be done against tropical peats from other countries. Based on the area weighing of our measurements, our annual estimate of emissions from these peat soils of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (SE) is within the higher range of emissions compared to other tropical peat fluxes. Southeast Asia provides a strong set of measurements from drained peatlands, in particular under oil palm plantations. Fluxes from SE Asia are highly variable, with an Rh of 18-56 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1 in drained forest and oil palm in Malaysia, 74-111\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> from a range of studies on drained oil palm plantations in SE Asia, and 24.9\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in a young oil palm plantation in Borneo. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions factor for drained cropland and fallow in the tropics is 51\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. By comparison, peatlands under arable cropping in Europe, which involves annual ploughing of soils, have been shown to emit between 24-92\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The management of peat soils in Uganda under potato cultivation involves an annual refreshment of the exposed peat from digging up of new peat to create new raised beds, thus exposing previously waterlogged soils to aerobic conditions. This introduction of fresh peat on an annual basis is different to the soil management of oil palm plantations in SE Asia where the soils are typically not disturbed post-planting. Therefore, it might be expected that the peat soils under repeated cultivation for potatoes would have emissions that remain high, unlike in sites that are not disturbed again after the initial planting period where emissions reduce after initial years since drainage [e.g. in where the initial emissions of 91\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> dropped to 47\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> over the first 6 years].\n\n## 4.3 Environmental variables\n\nThe relationships observed between WTD, soil temperature and R<sub>h</sub> were not unexpected, as this has previously been demonstrated in multiple studies. In some studies, this has been presented as a linear relationship with WTD or soil temperature only. As water table depth measurements do not require technical equipment, the relationship observed here has the potential for wide use by a variety of stakeholders to evaluate and model the impacts of hydrological management within these systems for reduced carbon losses.\n\nWhile we observed strong relationships in the soils which had not recently experienced disturbance, we had more varied and higher R<sub>h</sub> from the soils that had. Disturbance could cause changes to soil microbial and environmental properties, and has implications for future studies on these soils which need to take these impacts into account, especially when attempting to determine annual change. Other variables not measured here such as changes in soil bulk density, may have a significant combined effect on R<sub>h</sub> and will vary as a result of soil management over the year. There may also be an effect of the location of microbial biomass in the soil profile, which have been shown to be more prolific in the upper layers of the soil, with microbial extracellular enzymes involved in C cycling reducing with depth.\n\nDue to a lack of literature and available information on the use of these peat soils under this land use prior to our study, our sampling frequency was based on attempting to capture the range of environmental and management conditions that we anticipated would be experienced over the year. Considering that these soils are dug, cultivated, planted, harvested and fallowed at different times over a 12-month period, each of which bring different impacts to the soil, as well as differences in WTD and temperatures over the year, further studies should consider this when planning sampling and modelling of soil C losses. While our study succeeded in capturing different management and WTD conditions over the year, future studies could consider increased sampling intensity to a monthly emissions sampling campaign to ensure the extent of land management impacts are captured. Inclusion of regular soil sampling with these monthly measurements, in particular for bulk density and organic matter content, would enable further analysis of soil change and further refinement of relationships with key variables, and feed into model development and application for estimating land use impacts on these soils. Capturing the spatial variability from cultivated peatlands across the Kigezi highlands would strengthen the estimates of soil C losses for this peatland type and land use. Measurements of continuous *in-situ* WTD, soil and air temperature, and soil moisture content along with local climate data, would allow for accurate modelling of emissions over the longer term.\n\n## 4.4 Implications for Peatland Management\n\nIn terms of land management impacts and mitigation strategies, initial insight from this study shows considerable soil C losses due to soil drainage and disturbance. Although a number of years have passed since our field study was conducted, these management practices continue and thus these soil carbon losses are still relevant. Efforts to raise water levels would reduce these losses- one low-impact option for farmers could include the transfer of raised bed soils into trenches at the end of the harvest, to allow waterlogging of these soils during the fallow period. Alternatively, re-wetting and restoration of the wetland and exploration of alternative ecosystem service provision (including C payments for avoided emissions) or improved upland soil and crop management for enhanced incomes (and thus reduced household dependency on wetland cultivation) should also be explored. Before significant land management recommendations are made for these soils, the full GHG flux of the system should be further investigated, including the contribution of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions under waterlogged conditions, and the impact of the current land use including effects from the application of pesticides or fertilisers on water and soil quality.\n\n# 5 Conclusions\n\nManagement of these peat soils for potato cultivation leads to significant R<sub>h</sub>, in particular due to the mounding of fresh peats to ensure soils are raised above the water table. These raised beds had emissions nearly an order of magnitude higher than the trenches in between them.\n\nWhile there were lower air temperatures at night, nocturnal soil temperature and R<sub>h</sub> were not significantly affected and as such we conclude that there is no significant diurnal variability in emissions. Significant temporal variability was found over monthly time steps, rather than over hours or days, as we observed greater changes in key variables (soil temperature and WTD) from our measurements taken in the different months.\n\nSoil management (the different microtopography from the raised beds and trenches, and disturbance from planting and harvesting), as well as the soil temperature and water table depth were the most significant variables that impacted the rate of R<sub>h</sub>.\n\nOur area weighed annual flux estimate of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> is the first attempt at providing an emissions factor for this land use on these peat soils in Uganda."} 
{"question": "How do Root Border Cells (RBCs) contribute to plant resistance against aluminum toxicity?", "answer": "Root Border Cells (RBCs) contribute to plant resistance against aluminum toxicity by forming a protective barrier around the root tip, which prevents mechanical damage and reduces aluminum absorption.

Additionally, the removal of RBCs leads to increased aluminum absorption by the root tip, highlighting their protective role.", "context": "Root Border Cells as a Convenient Single Cell System to Study Plant-Environmental Interactions: A Case Study for Aluminum Tolerance\n==============\n\nYingming Feng ,Xingyun Chen ,Xuewen Li ,Yalin Li ,Wei Nong ,Jiao Tang ,Hongxiang Han ,Lei Shi ,Sergey Shabala ,Min Yu\n\n# Abstract\n\nRoot border cells (RBCs) are a group of cells that originated from the root cap meristem, which are developed by genetic regulation and play a variety of biological functions. Being composed of a homologous single cell population with high metabolic activity and intact cell walls, RBCs represent a highly useful tool for studying various aspects of plant mineral absorption and utilization, as well as plant-soil-microbiome interactions in the rhizosphere. Research on RBCs also promise to become a hotspot in the context of understanding root adaptive responses to hostile environments. In order to take advantage of RBCs as an ideal single cell system in plant-environmental interactions, we summarized the production and function of RBCs and built-up the methodology for RBCs culturing, purification, and quantity control for plant research. The latter is done by using a case study of the application of RBCs to study mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants. This work offers plant scientists a new cognition of adopting RBCs as a convenient single cell system for the multidisciplinary research including (but not limited to) plant physiology, development and genetics, nutrition, and stress and adaptation. Root border cells (RBCs) are derived from the root cap and represent a population of living cells with special physiological activity and biological roles that are different from the root cap cells *per se*. After being separated from the root cap, RBCs become more active in metabolism than the progenitor root cap cells; for example, they incorporate labeled amino acids into protein 2.6-fold more efficiently than the cells of the root cap. In addition, mRNA and protein were differentially expressed between root cap cells and RBCs. Since the production of RBCs is genetically regulated and RBCs played a variety of biological functions in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses occurred in the rhizosphere, RBCs were suggested as an ideal single cell system for the study the response of plant root cells to nutrient availability, environmental stresses, and in plant-microbial interactions. Some studies revealed that RBCs, which development is regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals, are biologically viable in the majority of higher plant species. This work reviews the research on RBCs in plant environment interaction and describes the case study of RBCs as a convenient single cell system to study plant responses to Al toxicity.\n\n# 1 Production of RBCs and its Advantages as Plant Single Cell Line\n\n## 1.1 Production of RBCs\n\nRBCs are a group of specialized cells that dissociate from the epidermis of the root cap and gather around the root tip, which were previously called sloughed root cap cells. As early as 1919, Knudson had pointed out that some sloughed root cap cells were metabolically active; however, this had not attracted much attention from researchers at that time. In fact, more than 90% of the sloughed root cap cells in most species are alive, and their development is genetically regulated and shown to maintain\u00a0a variety of biological functions even under adverse conditions. Hawes redefined these cells as RBCs, due to that they are located between the root surface and the soil, and emphasized that these cells were bioactive biotic boundary layers.\n\nRoot cap cells differentiate from root cap meristem through mitosis, and then go through a series of developmental stages such as starch synthesis stage, gravity sensing stage, and mucilage secretion stage to produce RBCs. The separation of border cells is the final stage of root cap cell development, and the total number of RBCs don\u2019t increase indefinitely but tends to saturate. For example, during seed germination, the number of RBCs is positively correlated with the root elongation, but when the root length reaches about 2.5cm, the number of RBCs reaches the maximum value.\n\nThe efficiency of RBCs production differs among species. Based on\u00a0the previous studies, we analyzed the proportion of RBCs from 11 families that contains nearly 30 different species. The number and viability of RBCs are different not only among plant families, but also within one family. The RBCs number varies greatly among different plant families, ranging from 20 in *Solanaceae* to ~12,000 in *Leguminou*s (**Figure\u00a01**; ). As shown in **Figure\u00a01**, RBCs number also varies greatly within one family, e.g. from about 5,000 in soybean ( *Glycine Max*) up to 12,000 in pea ( *Pisum sativum*). The environmental factors such as metal ions, the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2,</sub> etc., also affect the production of RBCs. For example, the RBCs number increased from approximately 10,000 per root tip in the control to 12,000 after Al exposure (**Figure\u00a01**; ). **Figure\u00a01** and **Table\u00a01** list the range of RBCs number among families and species affected by different metal ions. There is little doubt that RBCs function essentially at least among these plant species and respond actively to environmental signals especially stresses. Therefore, they represent natural homologous root cell lines that may be used in studying various aspects of plant-environmental interactions.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a01: RBCs in the Study of Metal Toxicity.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n \\toprule\n Metals & References & Effect \\\\\n \\midrule\n \\multirow{7}{*}{Al toxicity} & Yu et\u00a0al.

It has been reported that RBCs can quickly release antibiotics, specific enzymes, sugars, and other chemicals to regulate the growth of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes around the rhizosphere by changing gene expression under stress. Some scientists also called the RBCs as root extracellular traps (RET) and their associated secretions form a protective structure, which plays a major role in the interaction between roots and soil-borne microorganisms. In addition, as RBCs separation from root tip proceeds, the cells synthesize and secrete a hydrated mucilage that contains polysaccharides, secondary metabolites, antimicrobial proteins and extracellular DNA (exDNA), and this exDNA-based matrix seems to function in root defense in a way similar to that of recently characterized neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in mammalian cells. Therefore, the change of the rhizosphere can be communicated through the interaction between RBCs, various rhizosphere microorganisms, and toxic substances (such as Al toxicity), thereby generating practical significance.\n\nAt present, the role of RBCs in improving plant stress resistance, especially in resisting heavy metal ion toxicity, has become a new hotspot in the field of plant physiology. We summarized this research on the range of RBCs number in different families which were affected by metal stresses with the citation lists in **Figure\u00a01**. Among these studies, more attention was paid to Al toxicity. Under Al stress, the elongation of the root is significantly inhibited in a few minutes, and the root tip is the main target of Al stress sensing and toxicity. However, the most sensitive zone to Al toxicity is not the root cap and meristem, but root transition zone, a zone 2-3\u00a0mm away from the root tip. RBCs, produced and gathered around the root cap and meristem (**Figure\u00a02**), were assumed to not only prevent the protruding root tip from mechanical damage, but also act as a protective barrier for the root tip to absorb Al. When the Al concentration increased to 200 \u00b5M, the thickness of the adhesive layer exuded by RBCs increased, reducing the toxic effect of Al on roots. In addition, the removal of RBCs leads to the increase of Al absorption by root tip. As shown in **Figure\u00a02**, in-depth research on the response of RBCs *in situ* or *in vitro* to Al toxicity was carried out (which will be discussed later), indicating RBCs have been successfully applied in Al research and can be an example of RBCs as a highly convenient single cell system for the study of plant-rhizosphere interactions."} 
{"question": "What are the advantages of using RBCs over protoplasts for studying plant responses to Al toxicity?", "answer": "RBCs offer several advantages over protoplasts for studying plant responses to Al toxicity: they have a complete cell wall, allowing for the study of interactions and transport through the cell wall and plasma membrane; they respond consistently to chemicals, stresses, or signals due to their homogeneity; they can be easily harvested and purified in large quantities; and they form a protective sheath at the root tip, preventing Al from diffusing into the root tip and alleviating Al stress. In contrast, protoplasts lack cell walls, have non-physiological resting membrane potential values, and require complex techniques for homogeneity, limiting their applicability in stress physiology.", "context": "## 1.3 The Ideal Plant Single Cell System of RBCs\n\nAs a homologous single cell group with metabolic activity and complete cell wall, the discovery of RBCs provides a useful tool for studying many interesting research topics including (but not limited to) Al toxicity and tolerance, transport of nutrients and toxins through cell wall and plasma membrane, and a broad range of interactions (e.g. Si-Al, B-Al interaction) in the cell wall matrix. As RBCs are naturally produced in root tips of a large number of plant species, research on RBCs can reflect the real events that occurred in root tips, and the results are more reliable and applicable to root research in comparison to the other cell lines (e.g. suspension cells) or protoplast (without cell wall) and organelles (vacuoles), although they have other merits.\n\nThe second advantage is that RBCs can be acquired simply just by collection in water or solution, or even directly be wiped onto the glass slides for observation. It is well-known that the process of producing a new plant cell line generally takes a few years. The uniform population of protoplasts can be produced quicker (within several hours) but requires a prior optimization of the cocktail of enzymatic solution which is time consuming and may take months. Protoplasts are also highly artificial as they lack cell walls (and hence many wall-anchored proteins) as well as have non-physiological resting membrane potential values that questions applicability of findings on protoplasts to explain planta responses. There are no other plant tissues that can be distinguished and dissected so easily without any complex instrumentation and isolation processes. Also, RBCs can survive for a long time in a large osmotic potential range including distilled water without disintegration or visible cell damage.\n\nAnother advantage is the homogeneity of the RBCs that responds consistently to the chemicals, stresses, or signals which has a great advantage over root heterogeneity as cells from different root zones (root caps, meristem, transition, elongation, and mature zones) function and respond differently. Protoplasts derived from a specific cell type also possess this feature but creating a homogenous protoplast population may require cell-specific fluorescent labeling and the use of highly expensive and sophisticated techniques (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Most critically, lacking cell walls, protoplasts cannot be used to study the response of whole single cells to chemicals, stresses, and signals in the apoplast limiting their applicability in stress physiology.\n\nLast but not the least, previous studies have shown that the RBCs and their mucilage could form a protective sheath at the root tip, which prevented Al from diffusing into the root tip, thereby alleviating Al stress in plant root tip. The mucilage consists of a variety of molecules including cell wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans, secondary metabolites, anti-microbial proteins and peptides, and extracellular DNA. Mucilage can strongly bind Al in the rhizosphere. The mucilage can protect root tips from Al toxicity by tightly binding Al and sequestrating Al in mucilage, which consequently reduced the inhibition of root growth induced by Al and the absorption of Al by roots. Therefore, RBCs are considered to be the front of plant response and defense to stresses. Considering RBCs are easier to be harvested in large quantities and easily purified, they are widely used in studies on Al toxicity. Of specific interest is pea ( *Pisum sativum*) - Mendel\u2019s model genetic material that are capable to produce up to 10,000 RBCs from one root tip.\n\n# 2 Methodological Aspects of RBCs Production and Use: A Case Study for Al Response and Tolerance\n\n## 2.1 Production of RBCs\n\n### 2.1.1 Modified Solid Media Culture\n\nPea seeds are generally germinated in a Petri dish with sterilized 1.0% agar, and then a small amount of RBCs derived from the pea roots is harvested for further analysis. If required, the chemicals can be applied to the agar preparation. To maximize the cell yield, the growth procedure was modified as follows. Firstly, pea seeds are soaked in 0.1-2.0 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 10-48\u00a0h after sterilization in 7.5% sodium-hypochlorite solution. Then, the fully soaked seeds are transferred to the solid agar using tweezers, and a layer of filter paper is put on the culture medium to prevent the root tip to penetrate the culture medium. The cells are then cultured in a 20-32\u00b0C incubator for 24-72\u00a0h (depending on plant growth rate) and collected when the root length reaches 1.0-5.0\u00a0cm. Cells can be collected by immersing root tips in water and gently rotating to detach the RBCs from the root. The solid media culture was previously widely used for pathology studies as it can be completely sterilized and can conveniently incorporate the treatment of microorganisms. However, it is difficult to count the number of RBCs since RBCs will fall off when they are touched during the sampling process, which affects the experimental results. Also, a large number of RBCs could be potentially obtained by cutting off many root tips (one by one) from plants grown in multiple Petri dishes. However, it is practically not feasible since it is time and labor-consuming and the viability of the RBCs will drop significantly if separated from the root tips for more than 3\u00a0h. So the modified solid media culture is most suitable for the research requiring a small amount of RBCs and studies that require strict sterility.\n\n### 2.1.2 Mist Culture\n\nMist culture was invented for the mass harvest of RBCs by Yu\u2019s group and it was found that mist culture could quickly collect a large number of RBCs with high metabolic activity. The method involves the use of a mist incubator (depicted in **Figure\u00a03**) composed of a sealed box to keep the humidity, a plastic mesh rack to support seeds, a mist generator to produce fine mist for seed germination, a timer to control the operation of the mist generator. Seeds are put on the mesh rack and a mist generator is regularly used to keep the humidity in the sealed box at a constant level to ensure the normal growth and development of seeds. The mist production is controlled by a timer with a 15 s spaying time and at the time interval of 5\u00a0min, which can ensure the humidity in the box of 98%, and the temperature is controlled at 22-24\u00b0C. Under the plant gravitropism, the germinated root tips are neatly distributed under the mesh. After the roots are elongated to 2-3\u00a0cm, the mesh rack can be removed from the sealed box and put into water to collect RBCs. In addition, during the culture process, the nutrient composition may be modified as per purpose of the experiment, and various signaling and chemical agents could be also dispersed by mist generator.\n\n### 2.1.3 Quality and Quantity Control of Harvested RBCs\n\nThe RBCs are generally harvested (or collected) in the solution of the same chemical composition as for germination (0.1-2.0 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Cells are then purified by centrifugation at a centrifugal force of less than 500 (\u00d7g) to 1-3 times depending on the experiment requirement. Then the viability and number of RBCs are generally checked under a microscope for the quality and quantity control of the RBCs for further research. Generally, the total number of the pelleted RBCs is used to control the next experiment under the same amount of cell numbers. Some of these issues are discussed in more detail in the case study of Al tolerance below.\n\n## 2.2 The Case Study of RBCs in Research of Al Tolerance\n\n### 2.2.1 The Detection of the Number and Viability of RBCs Under Al Stress\n\nIt is a direct method to study the response of RBCs to Al stress by detecting the cell activity or quantity/proportion of viable cells. The number of cells can be counted by hemocytometer or by visual microscopic observations. For activity detection, many methods have been used, such as FDA (Fluorescent Diacetate) - PI (Propidium Iodide) viability staining, TTC (Triphenylte-trazolium Chloride) staining and trypan blue exclusion staining. Trypan blue is a cell reactive dye, and is commonly used to detect the activity of RBCs. In a living cell, the intact cell membrane can prevent trypan blue from entering the cells, so it will not be stained. If the membrane integrity is broken, the dead cells will be stained in blue due. During the operation of the trypan blue exclusion method, the solution containing RBCs and 0.5% trypan blue staining solution is mixed at 1:1 (V/V) and stained in the dark for 15\u00a0min. The blue-stained cells are dead cells and the non-stained cells are living cells. The cell survival rate is calculated according to the distribution of cells of the two colors under the microscope. RBCs in the majority of species examined are >90% viable. However, RBCs separated from the\u00a0root\u00a0cap died within 24\u00a0h under Al<sup>3+</sup> stress while the *in vitro* RBCs maintained 85%\u00a0viability\u00a0at 48\u00a0h after treatment.\n\n### 2.2.2 Removing Extracellular Al Ions From RBCs"} 
{"question": "What are the methods used for purifying RBCs in studies of ion absorption kinetics, and what are their advantages and disadvantages?", "answer": "Two methods are commonly used for purifying RBCs: microporous membrane filtration and centrifugation. Microporous membrane filtration uses a 0.4~5 \u00b5m filter membrane and is fast and accurate without washing off cells, but it risks mechanically damaging cells. Centrifugal purification is gentler, using a centrifugal force of less than 500 (\u00d7g), and effectively removes extracellular Al after 3-4 centrifugations, but it may be slower compared to membrane filtration.", "context": "RBCs can also be used to study the absorption kinetics of specific ions by single cells. When RBCs are treated *in vitro*, some metal ions treated outside or secreted by cells are required to be removed because of the reaction conditions of each element in the cells to be determined, as to purify RBCs. Generally, two methods are frequently used; one is microporous membrane filtration, and the second one is purification by centrifugation. Microporous membrane purification uses a 0.4~5 \u00b5m filter membrane to purify cells. The advantage of this method is that it is fast, accurate, and will not wash off cells. However, the method comes with the danger of mechanically damaging cells thus affecting their operation and viability. The centrifugal purification method is gentler. RBCs are centrifugated with a centrifugal force of less than 500 (\u00d7g), and lots machines, such as ICP(Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer), can be used to measure the degree of extracellular Al washing of each cell. The extracellular Al is completely removed after the 3-4 times centrifugation.\n\n### 2.2.3 Changes of Cell Wall Components of RBCs Under Al Stress\n\nThe cell wall is in the outermost layer of the cell. As the initial part of Al contact, it is the first barrier for plants to deal with Al stress, both the initial site of Al toxicity, and the main part of Al accumulation. The accumulation of Al in the cell wall is a prerequisite for the toxicity of Al to plant root tips. Pectin in the cell wall can promote the tolerance of plants to Al by regulating its distribution, so the combination of Al and cell wall polysaccharides plays an important role in the expression of Al toxicity and tolerance in plants. In the analysis of cell wall components, The extraction of cell wall and the separation of cell wall polysaccharide components were carried out according to Takayuki etal.. The total sugar of cell wall can be determined by the phenol-sulfuric\u00a0acid\u00a0method based on glucose; uronic acid is determined by pyrocatechol colorimetry; and pectin content is analyzed and determined according to the method of Li etal.. Through the study of the interaction between cell wall and Al, the experimental conditions for the tolerance of root border cells to Al ion stress were established and optimized, so as to better study the physiological and biochemical mechanism of Al toxicity at the cell level and provide a direct method for the screening of Al tolerant germplasm in the future.\n\n### 2.2.4 Biomineralization of Al in RBCs\n\nThe biomineralization process of cell induced self-assembly to form nanostructures has been a great interest subject to biologists and material chemists for many years. It is a process in which a small number of organic macromolecules (polysaccharides, proteins, and glycoproteins) are used as templates for a molecular operation to control the nucleation and growth of mineral phases and combine them into inorganic materials in a highly orderly manner. Inspired by nature, many researchers imitate the sheath structure outside biological cells by physical, chemical, or biochemical methods, especially the chemical modification method, which is a technology to prepare polyelectrolyte multilayer coating by alternately depositing anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on the solid surface through electrostatic interaction. Among them, layer-by-layer self-assembly (LBL) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) induction technology are common chemical modification methods. In recent years, chemical modification methods have been applied to yeast cells and rice suspension cells. The results show that the deposition of nano silicon can inhibit the entry of Cd<sup>2+</sup> into cells and effectively alleviate cadmium toxicity. For RBCs, Feng etal. applied layer-by-layer self-assembly technology to pea RBCs, showing that nanosilicon can keep the mitochondrial function of RBCs normal under Al stress, reduce the burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and finally reduce the programmed cell death, so that RBCs can maintain high viability without significant difference from the control group. This mechanism is like the RBCs in response to Al toxicity described in **Figure\u00a02**. Briefly, nano silicon deposition confers cells with high Al resistance. In addition, *in situ* RBCs can be used to study the change of cell wall mechanical properties and cell ion homeostasis under Al stress. Thus, RBCs offer material scientists a new single cell system for studing biomineralization.\n\n# 3 Prospects\n\nThe use of RBCs provides significant competitive advantages for plant cell physiology research compared with the other plant cell lines or protoplast-based methods. Studies involving RBCs are becoming a hot spot in the research of developmental biology, plant nutrition, and plant-environmental interactions. Adopting RBCs in research of Al toxicity provides opportunities for understanding the mechanisms underlying Al tolerance making the use of the cutting edge techniques such as microelectrode ion flux estimation(MIFE). There is also an exciting possibility of utilizing RBCs in research on biomineralization. We believe that RBCs, as an ideal single cell system, may disclose more molecular mechanisms of the response of cells to surrounding signals, if taken in combination with modern molecular tools such as single cell omics techniques."} 
{"question": "What are the main drivers of soil greenhouse gas fluxes in different land utilization types in Western Kenya?", "answer": "The main drivers of soil greenhouse gas fluxes in different land utilization types in Western Kenya are soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. These factors influence the soil-atmosphere exchange of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) through complex biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification.", "context": "Soil greenhouse gas emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya\n==============\n\nEsphorn Kibet ,Collins M. Musafiri ,Milka Kiboi ,Joseph Macharia ,Onesmus K. Ng\u2019etich ,David K. Kosgei ,Betty Mulianga ,Michael Okoti ,Abdirahman Zeila ,Felix Kipchirchir Ngetich\n\n# Abstract\n\n# Introduction\n\nThere is a vast data gap for the national and regional greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from different smallholder land utilization types in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at large. Quantifying soil GHG, i.e., methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from smallholder land utilization types, is essential in filling the data gap.\n\n# Methods\n\nWe quantified soil GHG emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya. We conducted a 26-soil GHG sampling campaign from the different land utilization types. The five land utilization types include 1) agroforestry M (agroforestry Markhamia lutea and sorghum), 2) sole sorghum (sorghum monocrop), 3) agroforestry L (Sorghum and Leucaena leucocephala), 4) sole maize (maize monocrop), and 5) grazing land.\n\n# Results and discussion\n\nThe soil GHG fluxes varied across the land utilization types for all three GHGs (p \u2264 0.0001). We observed the lowest CH4 uptake under grazing land (\u22120.35 kg CH4\u2013C ha\u22121) and the highest under sole maize (\u22121.05 kg CH4\u2013C ha\u22121). We recorded the lowest soil CO2 emissions under sole maize at 6,509.86 kg CO2\u2013Cha\u22121 and the highest under grazing land at 14,400.75 kg CO2\u2013Cha\u22121. The results showed the lowest soil N2O fluxes under grazing land at 0.69 kg N2O\u2013N ha\u22121 and the highest under agroforestry L at 2.48 kg N2O\u2013N ha\u22121. The main drivers of soil GHG fluxes were soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. The yield-scale N2O fluxes ranged from 0.35 g N2O\u2013N kg\u22121 under sole maize to 4.90 g N2O\u2013N kg\u22121 grain yields under agroforestry L. Nevertheless, our findings on the influence of land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes and yield-scaled N2O emissions are within previous studies in SSA, including Kenya, thus fundamental in filling the national and regional data of emissions budget. The findings are pivotal to policymakers in developing low-carbon development across land utilization types for smallholders farming systems.\n\n# Introduction\n\nSince industrialization, the global concentration of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes has risen. The upsurging population and the need for more food have led to land utilization intensification for improved crop production and heightened soil GHG emissions. Different land utilization types (LUTs) have varying soil GHG (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) fluxes potential. Through fertilizer, manure, and crop residues application, land utilization intensification could surge soil GHG fluxes in the quest for increased food production. Despite the GHG fluxes potential of different land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes, there is a lack of experimentally determined, smallholder-based data that can inform nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in most sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Kenya. Therefore, soil GHG fluxes measurements from common land utilization types among smallholder farmers in Kenya are essential to inform policy decisions and improve the National GHG reporting accuracy to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nSoil is a sink and source of soil GHG fluxes. The overall soil\u2013atmosphere exchange (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) results from oxidative and reductive reactions of soil C and N through complex biogeochemical processes, such as nitrification and denitrification. The soil\u2013atmosphere exchange across smallholder land utilization types is controlled by various soil physiochemical properties, including bulk density, soil organic carbon, nitrogen, pH, soil moisture, and soil temperature. For improved productivity, different land management practices, such as tillage and soil amendments, could trigger soil GHG fluxes. Climate factors, vegetation cover, and crop types across different utilization types significantly influence soil GHG fluxes. The diversified LUTs, such as grazed lands, agroforestry systems, and intensively managed croplands, increase the soil GHG gas uncertainty. The presence of leguminous trees increases GHG uncertainty. Despite the potential contribution of different land utilization types in the National GHG budget and in informing the NDCs in Kenya, there is limited availability of farm-level data.\n\n*Markhamia lutea* is a non-leguminous and evergreen tree belonging to the Bignoniaceae family. It is the most widespread tree species in Western Kenya and sequesters up to 65,000 kg C ha<sup>\u2212</sup>1 into the soil. Due to its economic viability, smallholder farmers use *Markhamia* in agroforestry systems. The amount of carbon input fixed by *Markhamia* could increase the substrate availability for microorganisms, thus increasing soil microbial activities. Additionally, the amount of C in the soil could increase bioturbation and exudation of soil organic matter triggering CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. *Leucaena leucocephala* is an evergreen and thornless tree belonging to the *Fabaceae* and *Mimosoideae* subfamily. *Leucaena* sp. accelerates nitrogen cycling, such as nitrification and denitrification. Leguminous trees could trigger emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O due to the high availability of N in the soil. Rosenstock et al. reported that leguminous trees input between 46 and 140\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> year<sup>\u22121</sup>. The amount of N is a function of C, thus the risk of accelerating GHG emissions. Therefore, soil GHG fluxes measurements from land utilization types managed by smallholders are essential\n\nThis study quantifies spatial and temporal GHG fluxes and yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from five land utilization types (LUTs) under smallholder farming conditions. The five LUTs were grazing field, sorghum monocrop, maize monocrop, and sorghum intercropped with agroforestry trees, i.e., *M. lutea* and *L. leucocephala*. We hypothesized that soil GHG fluxes in grazing land would be the highest due to continuous active root availability, animal droppings, and urine. In addition, integrating agroforestry trees into sorghum could increase crop yields and reduce yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\n## Study area\n\nWe conducted the soil GHG experimentation in a smallholder farm, with selected farm utilization types of interest, in Nyajuok sub-location, Siaya County, Western Kenya. The farm is at approximately 1,236 m above sea level and lies within the lower midland (LM1)\u2014\u201dsugarcane belt\u201d agroecological zone. It receives bimodal rainfall with long rain (LR) seasons from March to July and short rain (SR) from August to December. The annual rainfall ranges between 1,500 and 1,900 mm, and average annual temperatures of 21.80\u00b0C\u201320.9\u00b0C. The LR and SR season rainfall amounts range between 750 and 950\u00a0mm, and 600 and 800\u00a0mm, respectively. The highest temperatures are experienced from January to March. The area is suitable for maize ( *Zea mays*), sorghum ( *Sorghum bicolar*), common beans ( *Phaseolus vulgaris*), cowpeas ( *Vigna unguiculata*), sweet potatoes ( *Ipomoea batatas*), soya beans ( *Glycine max*), sunflower ( *Heliuthus annuus*), spinach ( *Spinacia oleracea*), and onions ( *Allium cepa*). The soil type is Ferralsols, with inherent low soil fertility. The low soil fertility constrains the implementation of cropping practices without amendments. The predominant primary land utilization types include grazing, agroforestry, maize, and sorghum.\n\n## Experimental setup and management\n\nThe study design was farmer designed and managed (Type III). The selection of the smallholder farm for field experimentation was informed by the existence of the five LUTs of interest (**Figure\u00a01**). The treatments (LUTs) had different dimensions: sole maize treatment measured 0.4\u00a0ha, grazing land measured 0.5\u00a0ha, while agroforestry M, sole sorghum, and agroforestry L measured 0.3\u00a0ha. The LUTs were (i) sorghum monocrop, (ii) sorghum-agroforestry\u2014 *M. lutea* (agroforestry M), (iii) sorghum-agroforestry *L. leucocephala* (agroforestry L), (iv) maize monocrop, and (v) grazing land. Under each LUT, we installed three PVCs circular static chambers to a 5-cm depth following Pelster et al.. The three static chambers were the replicates."} 
{"question": "What were the key field management practices observed during the experimental period, and how did they vary between the short rains (SR) and long rains (LR) seasons?", "answer": "The key field management practices observed during the experimental period included plowing, manure application, fertilization, planting, weeding, and harvesting.

Each chamber was composed of a lid (diameter, 10\u00a0cm; height, 8cm) and a base (diameter, 10; height, 10\u00a0cm). We limited the volume of the chamber headspace (by having a height of<5cm above the ground) to increase the fluxes detection sensitivity. The lid was fitted with a sampling rubber septum and a vent for maintaining pressure equilibrium between the chamber space and atmospheric pressure. The top is equipped with rubber to ensure airtight sealing during sampling headspace. The chambers remained undisturbed during the study period, except during major land management operations such as land preparation, manure application, fertilization, and planting. During such events, the chambers were removed and re-installed immediately after. Chambers at the grazing land were not removed during the entire study period.\n\nThe soil GHG fluxes measurements were conducted weekly during rainy periods and biweekly during dry periods. Additionally, soil GHG fluxes measurements were done following key field management activities such as plowing, manure or fertilizer application, planting, and rainfall. The chamber base and lid were held airtight using the circular rubber band during each sampling event. During sampling, a digital thermometer (TFA thermometer, Zum Ottersberg, Wertheim, Germany) was placed inside the chamber space to monitor temperature changes. Soil GHG samples were collected between 0800 and 1200 hours; the time was considered representative of the diurnal temperature, thus limiting variation in fluxes patterns. During each sampling event, 60\u00a0ml of gas was sampled from each chamber using a 60-ml capacity syringe fitted with a Luer-lock, the first 20\u00a0ml of the gas sample was used to flush 20-ml glass vials, and 40\u00a0ml was injected into 20-ml glass vials to achieve overpressure and minimize chances of contamination due to ambient air diffusion before analysis. The soil GHG samples were collected at 0-, 10-, 20-, and 30-min intervals. The gas samples were transported to Mazingira Laboratories (the International Livestock Research Institute) for analysis.\n\nThe soil CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations were analyzed using SRI 8610C gas chromatography (GC). The GC was equipped with methanizer for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>. The GC was tailored with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and a <sup>63</sup>Ni-electron capture detector (ECD) for N<sub>2</sub>O. We used 20\u00a0ml of nitrogen as a carrier gas during the soil GHG concentration analysis. We calibrated the GC after every four samples using a known concentration of [CO<sub>2</sub> (403, 810, 1,458, and 2,420 ppm), CH<sub>4</sub> (2, 8, 20, and 49 ppm), and N<sub>2</sub>O (329, 761, 1,190, and 2,530 ppb)]. We used the relationship between peak area and concentration over the 30-min headspace to determine the soil GHG fluxes. Since FID assumes a linear function upon chamber closure, the CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were calculated using linear regression. We used nonlinear and power functions between N<sub>2</sub>O mass and time to calculate soil N<sub>2</sub>O concentration, since the ECD assumes a nonlinear power function between time and N<sub>2</sub>O masses. The three chambers represented replicates in each LUTs, given that the experiment was mounted on real smallholder fields, hence not a typical experimental design.\n\n## Soil GHG fluxes calculation\n\nThe soil GHG fluxes were calculated by accounting for environmental factors, including air pressure and temperature, following the ideal gas law following **Equation 1**.\n\n$$\nFghg=\\frac{b\\times Mw\\times Vch\\times 60\\times {10}^6}{Ach\\times Vm\\times {10}^9} \\tag{Equation 1}\n$$\n\nwhere *Fghg* is the flux rate, *b* is the slope of increase/decrease in concentration, *Mw* is the molecular weight of component (g mol<sup>\u22121</sup>), *Vch* is chamber volume (m3), *Ach* is chamber area (m<sup>2</sup>), and *Vm* is the corrected standard gaseous molar volume (m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) given by **Equation 2**.\n\n$$\nVm=22.4\\times {10}^{-3}{m}^{-3}mo{l}^{-1}\\times \\frac{273.15+Temp}{273.15}\\times \\frac{airpressure}{1013} \\tag{Equation 2}\n$$"} 
{"question": "What factors were found to significantly influence soil CO2 emissions in the study?", "answer": "Soil CO2 emissions were positively correlated with soil organic carbon (p=0.0001), soil moisture (p=0.04), and clay content (p=0.03).", "context": "The quality of gas concentration was checked using R<sup>2</sup> of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. For validation and reliability of the GHG concentration, we discarded the fourth sampling interval data in the event of R<sup>2</sup><0.90 for CO<sub>2</sub>, as fluxes were assumed to have experienced leakage. However, upon discarding the fourth sampling interval and the R<sup>2</sup> was still<90%, we assumed contamination, and that dataset was discarded for analysis. We computed the minimum detection limits for both linear and nonlinear models following Parkin et al. for CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions at \u00b10.03 and \u00b10.08 CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C mg m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>, 2.87 and 9.52 mg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>, and \u00b13.16 and \u00b19.90 \u03bcgN<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>. We observed both negative and positive soil\u2013atmosphere CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O exchange, indicating that the soils acted as both sources and sinks of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. The soil\u2013atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> balances were always positive, indicating that the ground was the net source of CO<sub>2</sub>. We computed cumulative CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions for each LUT replicate using linear interpolation between sampling days based on the trapezoidal rule, following Barton et al.. We also calculated the net global warming potential (GWP) following Mu et al., where every gas unit was converted to CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent by using a factor of 298=N<sub>2</sub>O and 25=CH<sub>4</sub>.\n\n## Soil and weather monitoring\n\nWe collected soil samples at 0\u201320 cm depth for soil organic carbon, bulk density, and soil texture analysis using a 5-cm diameter and 5-cm height core ring (Eijkelkamp Agrisearch Equipment, Giesbeek, The Netherlands). We collected four samples from every LUT totaling 60 samples. We mixed the samples for soil texture analysis to form one composite sample in every LUT, totaling five samples. The soil samples were analyzed following Okalebo et al.. For soil organic carbon determination, we used the Walkley\u2013Black method. We oven-dried the soil samples at 105\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h for soil bulk density determination. The soil bulk density was determined gravimetrically following Okalebo et al.. We determined the soil texture using the hydrometer method. We used the remaining samples to determine soil pH using distilled water. We collected rainfall data using a manual rain gauge installed in the study area. We collected 0\u20135 cm depth samples for soil moisture content determination during the soil GHG sampling events. Soil moisture was determined by oven drying at 105\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, and moisture was determined gravimetrically. We also measured the chamber temperature and soil temperature using a thermometer (TFA thermometer, Zum Ottersberg, Wertheim, Germany).\n\n## Crop yields and yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions\n\nWe sampled 3\u00a0m \u00d7 3\u00a0m plot dimensions across the LUTs except for the grazing land to estimate crop grain yields. Three subplots were selected to estimate crop yields in each land utilization type. We sampled four planting holes (eight plants) to determine crop biomass. We determined the wet weight of the crop harvest using an electronic balance. We air-dried the soil roots, leaves, stems, and grains sub-samples for 3 weeks and oven-dried the subsamples at 60\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. We weighed subsamples after drying and converted the yields to kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>. We reported the grain yields for maize and sorghum at 12.5% moisture content following Ngetich et al.. We divided the soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes **(**gN<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) with the grain yields (kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) to determine the yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions following Musafiri et al..\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nThe GHG data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS 9.4 software. Before analysis, we tested the normality of soil GHG fluxes using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. The soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were not normally distributed; thus, they were log-transformed. We tested the influence of the land utilization types, seasons, and replicates on soil GHG fluxes using a mixed linear model. We used land utilization types as fixed effects and replicates and seasons as random factors. We performed Pearson correlation to test the relationship between soil GHG fluxes and soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, clay content, soil temperature, soil moisture, and roots.\n\n# Results and discussion\n\n## Soil and weather data\n\nSoil bulk density significantly ( *p*<0.0001) differed across land utilization types (**Table\u00a01**). We observed the highest soil bulk density of 1.53\u00a0g cm<sup>\u22121</sup> under grazing land and the lowest at 1.20\u00a0g cm<sup>\u22121</sup> under agroforestry L. The soil organic carbon varied significantly ( *p*<0.0001) among the land utilization types (**Table\u00a01**). We found the highest soil organic carbon, 2.23%, under agroforestry M and the lowest, 0.60%, under sole maize. The soil texture was loam across different land utilization types (**Table\u00a02**).\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a02: Baseline soil properties under different land utilization types at 0\u201320 cm depth in Siaya County, Kenya.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n LUTs1 & Bulk density (g cm\u2212<sup>3</sup>) & Nmin & SOC(\\%) & Soil pH & \\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Soil texture(\\%)} \\\\\n \\hline\n & & & & & Sand & Clay & Silt \\\\\n \\midrule\n Agroforestry M & 1.23<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 6.0 & 2.23<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.08 & 5.2 & 47 & 19 & 34 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole sorghum & 1.40<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 4.3 & 1.50<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.03 & 4.9 & 48 & 15 & 37 \\\\\n \\hline\n Agroforestry L & 1.20<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 7.5 & 2.07<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 5.4 & 46 & 18 & 36 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole maize & 1.50<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 4.2 & 0.61<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.05 & 4.8 & 52 & 18 & 30 \\\\\n \\hline\n Grazing land & 1.53<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 6.1 & 2.01<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.04 & 5.1 & 50 & 18 & 32 \\\\\n \\hline\n *P* value & <0.0001 & & <0.0001 & & \u2013 & \u2013 & \u2013 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T2}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nSoil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were positively correlated to soil organic carbon ( *p*=0.0001), soil moisture ( *p*=0.04), and clay content ( *p*=0.03) (**Table\u00a03**).

We observed the highest average soil moisture under agroforestry M and the lowest under sole maize. The cumulative seasonal rainfall was 728 and 737\u00a0mm during the SR20 and LR21 (**Figure\u00a02A**). The overall rainfall amount was consistent with the long-term average rainfall amount in the study area, ranging between 800 and 1,900 mm.\n\n## Soil GHG fluxes\n\nWe observed both negative and positive soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across land utilization types throughout the study periods. The soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes ranged from \u221219.08 to 158.18 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> (**Figure\u00a03A**). We observed high N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes following precipitation events. The soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were mainly positive, but we observed few soil N<sub>2</sub>O uptakes, especially during the off-season.\n\nThe soil CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were generally negative across the land utilization types, with the highest uptake of \u2212200.00 \u03bcg CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> (**Figure\u00a03B**).

However, we sporadically observed positive soil CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes with the highest of 60 \u03bcg CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>. The soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ranged from 38.98 to 423.92 mgCO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> across the LUTs (**Figure\u00a03C**). We observed low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on July 20 and January 21 across the LUTs. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were lower under sole maize and sorghum than in grazing land. We also observed high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions following precipitation events throughout the study periods. Compared to all the LUTs, agroforestry M had the highest peaks following precipitation events."} 
{"question": "What factors contribute to the variation in soil N2O emissions across different land utilization types in East Africa?", "answer": "The variation in soil N2O emissions across different land utilization types in East Africa is influenced by several factors, including the application of animal manure, which increases the availability of labile carbon, leading to higher N2O emissions. High rainfall events increase soil moisture, reducing oxygen availability and promoting denitrification. The presence of animal dung and urine in grazing lands also contributes to increased N2O emissions, especially upon soil rewetting. Additionally, farm management practices such as fertilization and the timing of these activities with precipitation events play a significant role in influencing N2O emissions.", "context": "The soil N<sub>2</sub>O results from this study are consistent with other studies conducted in the range of previous studies in East Africa that found a range of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from \u221220.00 to 200 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> in maize crop under similar conditions. Grazing land also resulted in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions of up to 150 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>, which was similar to the findings of Ortiz-Gonzalo et al., who found a range of emissions from 20 to 500 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> in the pasture land due to application of dung (mixture of dung and urine). The daily N<sub>2</sub>O reached peaks during high rainfall events that could be explained by the difference in soil moisture that led to the reduction in oxygen, hence denitrification. The onset of rains that coincided with planting and fertilization offered ideal conditions for nitrification and denitrification processes due to reduced oxygen availability limiting microbial activity. The four LUTs were applied with animal manure (**Table\u00a01**), which is the controlling factor in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by increasing the availability of labile carbon. Hickman et al. found an increase in N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes by 58% from the fertilized chambers upon application of manure compared to unfertilized plots under *Zea mays* in western Kenya. The availability of water in soil micropores coupled with the availability of carbon from manure increases the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions unless saturation is reached. Even though we had no data on different levels of soil saturation, Wanyama et\u00a0al. reported that the production of N<sub>2</sub>O is produced until soil saturation is reached, where N<sub>2</sub>O is consumed due to the limitation of oxygen in the soil. In addition, the availability of dung and urine deposition under grazing land could have increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions upon soil rewetting. Mineralization in the soil leads to the production of N<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, the peaks under grazing land could be explained by dung presence on grasses. Generally, the key events that elaborate N<sub>2</sub>O peak are high precipitation, increasing soil moisture content, and fertilizer application. Macharia et al. and Musafiri et al. found that N<sub>2</sub>O impulse is due to major events, as listed earlier. Under grazing land, the peaks can be explained by animal dung and urine deposition.\n\nSoils acted as CH<sub>4</sub> sinks and sources during the study period. These results were similar to the findings conducted in East Africa that found a range of 0.02 to \u221260 CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> in smallholder croplands under similar condition. There was low CH<sub>4</sub> production during the dry period due to the high rate of gas diffusivity and favorable aerobic conditions for CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. However, during the onset of rainfall, which led to an increase in moisture content, the CH<sub>4</sub> uptake became low, reflecting the effects of moisture on CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes.\n\nWe observed an increase in soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission at the onset of the rainfall across the LUTs. These observations are similar to the findings from SSA that found a range of 30\u2013400 mgCO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> under different land use types under similar conditions. In addition, Pelster et al. and Musafiri et\u00a0al. reported similar findings to our results following major events such plowing, planting, and fertilization on smallholder farms. Generally, farm management practices and soil humidity perturbation affect both soils biotic and abiotic factors. An influence on soil microclimate affects bio-faunal activities that drive carbon in the soil, thus soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Therefore, farm activities such as fertilization, which coincided with precipitation across different LUT explain the high pulse of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. For the case of grazing, we observed high pulse CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the first rainfall events, which can be elaborated by the rewetting of animal droppings, thus causing the Birch effect. However, there were instances of low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to low moisture content, which is the function of precipitation (**Table\u00a03**). In addition, there were periods with no plants in the field except grazing land during the study period. Therefore, it is imperative to note the contribution of plants in respiratory processes, such as root respiration, that is likely to increase soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\n## Cumulative GHG fluxes\n\nThe cumulative seasonal soil GHG emissions (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) significantly varied across the land utilization types (**Table\u00a04**). We observed the highest CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes under sole maize (38% more compared to all LUTs during SR 20 and LR 21. We observed the lowest CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes under agroforestry L and sole sorghum M during SR 20. During LR 21, there was 40% more CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under agroforestry L. We observed 30% and 36% more N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under agroforestry L than all the LUTs during SR 20 and LR 21, respectively. However, we observed 13% less N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under agroforestry M than all the LUTs during SR 21. Grazing land emitted high CO<sub>2</sub> (29% and 25% during SR 20 and LR 21, respectively) compared to other LUTs. We observed significant seasonal differences ( *p*<0.0001) and seasonal interactions ( *p*<0.0001) during the study.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a04: Soil GHG emissions (mean \u00b1 SEM) as influenced by land utilization types between July 2020 and May 2021 in Siaya County, Kenya.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Season1 & LUTs2 & CH<sub>4</sub> (kg CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & CO<sub>2</sub> (kg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & N<sub>2</sub>O (kg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013Nha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & Net GWP kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq ha<sup>\u22121</sup> year<sup>\u22121</sup> \\\\\n \\midrule\n SR 2020 & Agroforestry M & \u22120.43<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 6,347.52<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 168.25 & 0.26<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 67.92 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole sorghum & \u22120.42<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 6,208.58<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 344.15 & 0.40<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 108.89 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Agroforestry L & \u22120.23<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.05 & 5,108.25<sup>cd</sup> \u00b1 551.70 & 0.58<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 166.03 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole maize & \u22120.87<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.03 & 3,967.88<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 620.55 & 0.43<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 0.03 & 106.02 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Grazing land & \u22120.34<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.09 & 8,949.50<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 515.86 & 0.29<sup>bc</sup>0.05 & 77.28 \\\\\n \\hline\n & p-value & 0.001 & 0.0001 & 0.002 & \\\\\n \\hline\n LR 2021 & Agroforestry M & \u22120.20<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 5,367.04<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 129.41 & 1.28<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 377.18 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole sorghum & \u22120.004<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 4,110.33<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 209.15 & 0.69<sup>cd</sup> \u00b1 0.05 & 205.01 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Agroforestry L & \u22120.26<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 4,423.09<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 419.20 & 1.90<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.11 & 558.87 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole maize & \u22120.18<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 2,541.98<sup>d</sup>252.01 & 1.00<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 303.35 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Grazing land & \u22120.005<sup>b</sup>0.01 & 5,451.25<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 382.33 & 0.40<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 120.55 \\\\\n \\hline\n & p-value & <0.0001 & 0.0001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\hline\n Cumulative & Agroforestry M & \u22120.63<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 11,714.56<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 110.76 & 1.54<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 444.86 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole sorghum & \u22120.42<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 10,318.91<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 931.05 & 1.09<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 289.69 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Agroforestry L & \u22120.49<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.04 & 9,531.34<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 948.53 & 2.48<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.11 & 736.53 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole maize & \u22121.05<sup>e</sup> \u00b1 0.26 & 6,509.86<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 561.37 & 1.43<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.5 & 531.13 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Grazing land & \u22120.35<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.09 & 14,400.75<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 1,210.88 & 0.69<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.07 & 223.37 \\\\\n \\hline\n & p-value & <0.0001 & 0.001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\hline\n & Seasonal *p* vaue<sup>4</sup> & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\hline\n & Season*LUT<sup>5</sup> & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T4}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nAnnual cumulative soil GHG emissions varied across the land utilization types (**Table\u00a04**).

Conversely, grazing land emitted 22% less N<sub>2</sub>O than agroforestry L. The global warming potential was positive across the LUTs and seasons.

{"question": "How do management practices affect methane (CH4) uptake in different land utilization types (LUTs)?", "answer": "Management practices such as manure application and tillage impact soil organic carbon, which serves as substrates for methanogenic archaea, influencing CH4 uptake. For example, sole maize showed high CH4 uptake due to low soil organic carbon (SOC), while agroforestry systems had high CH4 uptake due to low soil bulk density, which increases gas diffusivity rate. Seasonal variations, such as flooding, can also affect CH4 uptake by creating anaerobic conditions suitable for CH4 production.", "context": "The soil acted as a net sink of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes. The cumulative soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake ranged from \u22120.21 to \u22120.68 kg CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup> consistent with previous studies in East Africa under similar conditions on smallholder farms. The difference in soil CH<sub>4</sub> due to management practices across the LUTs explains the difference in CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. Management practices such as manure application and tillage greatly impact the soil organic carbon that acts as substrates for methanogenic archaea. Sole maize had high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake due to low SOC (**Table\u00a02**). Soil bulk density is among the factors that control CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes. Generally, soil bulk density is a function of soil porosity, thus predicting diffusivity rate. Agroforestry M had a high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. This could be explained by low soil bulk density (**Table\u00a02**), which increases the gas diffusivity rate. The high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake in the agroforestry M could be attributed to the high diffusivity rate due to low soil bulk density coupled with high porosity. On the contrary, during SR 2020, there was low CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under agroforestry M due to flooding that could have created anaerobic conditions suitable for CH<sub>4</sub> production.\n\nThe low soil bulk density could account for soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under agroforestry L. In addition, even though we did not measure mineral N, *leucacena leucocephala* could have fixed nitrogen in the soil. Thus, increasing NH4+\u2013N competes for the mono-oxygenase enzyme, accelerating CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. According to a review by Kim et al., the agroforestry systems increase N in the soil. In addition, the application of manure (**Table\u00a01**) coupled with varied management practices leads to an N gradient across the LUTs, hence different CH<sub>4</sub> uptake levels. We observed low CH<sub>4</sub> uptake cumulatively and during SR 2020 season. This could be due to high soil organic carbon that functions as substrates for methanogenesis processes. In addition, animal trampling causes soil structure disturbances, thus high soil bulk density, leading to the establishment of methanogenic archaea.\n\nWe also observed seasonal treatment interactions, which could be attributed to the differences in crop performance and precipitation during the two cropping seasons. The low CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes during the LR 21 could be due to increased CH<sub>4</sub> production. The applied manure not used by crops necessitated CH<sub>4</sub> production. The applied organic amendments in the different land utilization types could increase anaerobic microsites, resulting in CH<sub>4</sub> production.\n\nThe cumulative annual soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ranged from 6,509.86 to 14,400.75 kg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>, which was slightly higher compared to the previous studies in Kenya that found a range of 1,391\u20136,000 kg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup> emissions under similar conditions. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were seasonal, and they followed major events such as precipitation, plowing, and fertilization similar to observations by Pelster et al.. We observed a significant difference in CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes across LUTs and seasons, with grazing having high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across the season. The highest soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in grazing land could be attributed to high soil organic carbon available due to continuous root availability from *Solanum incanum* that could have favored nutrient pumping and consequently increased emissions. Additionally, the high amount of carbon concentration under grazing land (**Table\u00a02**) could have provided the substrate and energy for microorganisms, thus high decomposition rates. Rosenstock et al. and Wachiye et al. found an increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emission with increasing carbon in soil compartments. This can explain the high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under grazing land. The continuous availability of animal droppings for the entire study period explains the high amounts of carbon compared to other LUTs. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be elaborated by the positive correlation of SOC with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (**Table\u00a03**). Therefore, with an increase in carbon, there is a likelihood of an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\nWe also observed high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under agroforestry systems (agroforestry L and agroforestry M) across the seasons than the monocrops (sole maize and sorghum) LUTs, which can be elaborated by the availability of roots that increases carbon in the soil compartment (**Table\u00a02**) through root degradation. Additionally, the decomposition of leaf litter fall could increase the amounts of carbon, thus high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. On the contrary, the monocrops had low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to low carbon in soil compartments (**Table\u00a02**). Generally, nutrient mining due to harvesting with limited nutrient replenishment could have resulted in low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In addition, high soil bulk density (**Table\u00a02**) results in low soil atmosphere exchange due to low gas diffusivity hence low CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes.\n\nThe variability of CO<sub>2</sub> across the land utilization types can be attributed to the difference in vegetation; this immensely affects the rate of emissions at plants\u2019 roots. The photosynthesis rate differs, affecting respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. The effect of textural characteristics in the LUTs could have majorly contributed to varied CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Additionally, seasonal interactions reflect the effect of moisture on CO<sub>2</sub>. However, we only reported the soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (decomposition and root respiration). Therefore, the entire CO<sub>2</sub> budget from the soil and photosynthesis is essential.\n\nThe cumulative annual soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across the land utilization types were consistent with previous studies in East Africa that found a range of 0.07\u20134.3 kg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> under similar conditions. The difference between soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across LUTs could be due to changes in soil moisture. Although the amount of N was not determined, *L. leucocephala* under agroforestry L that fixes N into soils could have led to high N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. Cubillos-Hinojosa et al. found that *L. leucocephala* has a high C:N ratio because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen to the soils. These phenomena could explain the difference in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under the two agroforestry systems (agroforestry M and agroforestry L). We also observed lower N<sub>2</sub>O emissions cumulatively under agroforestry M than agroforestry L due to the difference in species. Generally, the amount of soil N in the agroforestry systems is species dependent, which could explain the difference in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions among the two LUTs. Furthermore, soil organic carbon acts as substrates for the soil microbes, consequently influencing denitrification and nitrification. The high amounts of soil organic carbon under the agroforestry systems (**Table\u00a02**) could have led to high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. In addition, the amount of leaf litterfall could have necessitated anaerobic conditions under the agroforestry systems, thus high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Zheng et al. reported high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under croplands applied with stovers.\n\nThere was low production of N<sub>2</sub>O under grazing cumulatively than other LUTs. We expected high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions due to the availability of animal droppings throughout the study period. Zhu et\u00a0al. reported that nitrous emissions correlate linearly with the amount of dung deposited on grasses. In addition, Pelster et al. reported high N<sub>2</sub>O in grassland. We found a negative correlation between BD and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Similar to this finding, Wanyama et al. found a negative correlation between N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and soil bulk density. Thus, high bulk density under grazing land explains low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, although in the denitrification process, it is expected that bulk soils favor denitrification due to the consumption of O<sub>2</sub>, thus avoiding diffusion. Other factors, such as soil texture and temperature, could have played a major role in the nitrification and denitrification processes. Sole maize and sole sorghum showed low denitrification across the season (**Table\u00a04**) compared to other LUTs. This could be explained by the low amount of carbon (which explains the low availability of labile carbon) that is necessary for denitrification processes by acting as electron donors for microbial activities. However, our study contradicted the findings of Wanyama et al., which found that high soil organic carbon correlates linearly with N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. We found a negative correlation between soil organic carbon with N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Low soil pH under sole maize and sole sorghum could have limited denitrification processes.\n\nGenerally, soil pH influences soil microbial activities. Low soil pH favors N<sub>2</sub>O uptake. Rosenstock et al. found an increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions with increasing soil pH. We can also attribute low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under sole maize and sole sorghum to clay content. The low amount of clay content necessitated the nitrification process at the expense of denitrification."} 
{"question": "How does crop residue retention impact N2O emissions in flood-prone soils, and what are the challenges faced by Kenyan smallholder farmers in implementing this practice?", "answer": "Crop residue retention can increase N2O emissions in flood-prone soils due to the induction of labile carbon, which acts as electron donors during the denitrification process. However, Kenyan smallholder farmers face challenges in implementing crop residue retention due to competition for residues as livestock feed and fuel, which limits its use and contributes to lower N2O emissions under sole sorghum cropping.", "context": "Crop residue retention is essential in improving fertility and yields. The novelty of crop residue retention on the field due to its ability to incorporate nutrients could have mixed effects on the soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. Crop residue retention increases the induction of labile carbon that plays a fundamental role during the denitrification process by acting as electron donors to soil microbes. The study was conducted on flood-prone soils that provided favorable conditions for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. The crop residue retention could increase N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. However, crop residue retention is limited in most Kenyan smallholder cropping practices due to livestock competition and fuel, which partly explains low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under sole sorghum.\n\n## Maize and sorghum production\n\nThe grain yield ranged from 5,221.5 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (sole maize, n=3) to 505.3\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (sole sorghum, n=3) (**Table\u00a05**). We observed low roots, leaves, and stem production during the season (**Table\u00a05**). The maize and sorghum crops planted by the smallholder farmer during the LR 21 failed due to poor rainfall timing. During the SR 20 seasons, the yield scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions ranged from 0.35\u00a0g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup> grain yields under sole maize to 4.90\u00a0g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup> grain yields under agroforestry L. We observed a yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions of 1.98 and 3.07\u00a0g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup> grain yields under sole sorghum and agroforestry M.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a05: Maize and sorghum production under different land utilization types during the SR 20 in Siaya County, Kenya.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n LUTs1 & Roots (kg ha\u22121) & Stems (kg ha\u22121) & Leaves (kg ha\u22121) & Grains (kg ha\u22121) & Total Biomass (kg ha\u22121) & N<sub>2</sub>O YSE(g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) \\\\\n \\midrule\n Agroforestry M & 198.8 \u00b1 42.58 & 2,446.5 \u00b1 37.69 & 1,597.5 \u00b1 1.90 & 505.3 \u00b1 52.70 & 4,748.1 \u00b1 62.81 & 3.07 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole sorghum & 306.3 \u00b1 80.48 & 3,258.0 \u00b1 17.15 & 2,137.5 \u00b1 4.74 & 505.6 \u00b1 13.78 & 6,207.4 \u00b1 103.01 & 1.98 \\\\\n \\hline\n Agroforestry L & 141.4 \u00b1 14.36 & 1036.5 \u00b1 7.26 & 934.5 \u00b1 0.76 & 508.0 \u00b1 35.69 & 2,620.4 \u00b1 40.08 & 4.90 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole maize & 203.0 \u00b1 8.95 & 3,478.5 \u00b1 11.49 & 3,942.0 \u00b1 8.97 & 5,221.5 \u00b1 213.99 & 12,845.0 \u00b1 234.91 & 0.35 \\\\\n \\hline\n Grazing land<sup>2</sup> & \u2013 & \u2013 & \u2013 & \u2013 & \u2013 & \u2013 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T5}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nThe sorghum grain yields (505\u2013508 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> for one cropping season) were close to 464\u2013540 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> reported by Njagi et al. and Musafiri et al.. However, the sorghum yields were lower than the potential sorghum productivity of 4,000 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>. The maize grain yields of 5,222 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> were consistent with those reported by previous studies in Western Kenya, ranging between 500 and 5,600 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>. The low sorghum productivity in the study area could be attributed to poor rain timing and agronomic management coupled with *S. hermonthica* infestation. The *S. hermonthica* is a significant threat to sorghum production in Western Kenya, resulting in reduced grain productivity. The calculated N<sub>2</sub>O yield scaled emissions ranged between 0.35 and 4.90\u00a0g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup> and was consistent with 0.024\u201367 g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup>. The low yield-scaled emission could be attributed to the low soil GHG emissions across the land utilization types. It is noteworthy that sole sorghum had higher yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions than sole maize. This could be attributed to the low sorghum productivity due to poor management and *S. hermonthica* infestation, lowering the yields. Notably, the improved land utilization management, such as agroforestry L and agroforestry M, led to increased yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, the yield scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were based on cereal crop grain yields.\n\nDespite the importance of agroforestry systems (agroforestry L and agroforestry M) in terms of carbon input and YSE, their potential to contribute to global warming is high. The agroforestry systems exhibited high net GWP compared to monocrops (sole sorghum and sole maize). Therefore, in terms of YSE, there is a tradeoff between food production and GHG. It is imperative to note the importance of agroforestry systems in food production and the ability to input carbon, a function of N in soil compartments. The viability of integrating plants and crops is under disputation. It can increase yields and GHG emissions, and it can also increase yields. In addition, the monocrops have varied implications on edaphic factors and consequently climate change. Despite low GWP, sole sorghum and sole maize contributed to the deterioration of soil health. Therefore, the balance between crop productivity in smallholder farms can be achieved through agroforestry systems because it improves soil health. We advocate for agroforestry systems due to their ability to improve soil health, climate regulation, and food production.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThere is a vast data gap on the quantity of soil GHG fluxes across different land utilization types in Kenya. We quantified the soil GHG fluxes from five common land utilization types. In line with our hypothesis, grazing land had the highest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while sole maize had the lowest. We also hypothesized that agroforestry L could increase crop yields and reduce yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. There was high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under monocrops. The soil GHG fluxes were CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were of low magnitude although consistent with other studies in Kenya. The most critical drivers influencing GHG in this experiment were soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. Improved land utilization types (agroforestry M and agroforestry L) did not increase grain yields but increased yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Due to the soil\u2019s high moisture levels occasioned by frequent waterlogging under agroforestry systems, the yields were low, while the YSE was high. The high YSE can be reduced by enhancing the yields through improving fertilization and managing *Striga* weeds infestations. However, the study did not consider the importance of the agroforestry trees to smallholder farmers, such as fodder crops for feeding livestock ( *L. leucocephala*) and timber from *M. lutea.* Following our findings, there is a need for further studies to consider the benefits of agroforestry integration on the income among smallholder farmers. This shades more light on the tradeoffs expressed as income-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes of agroforestry land utilization compared to monocropping. Our findings are essential, as they established the contribution of different land utilization types, thus filling the data gap on the National GHG budget."}

Smith\n\n# Abstract\n\nOur study measured heterotrophic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in a drained peatland under potato cultivation in south-western Uganda. Soil carbon losses have not previously been reported for this land use, and our study set out to capture the range and temporal variation in emissions, as well as investigate relationships with key environmental variables. Soil chamber-based emission measurements were taken over five days at four points in time over the year to capture daily and monthly variability, including day and night sampling to capture any diurnal variations in temperatures and soil flux. Differences in soil microtopography from mounding of soils for potato beds and drainage trenches had a significant effect on the rate of soil flux. Diurnal sampling showed no significant difference in emissions or soil temperatures in the raised potato beds between day and night. More significant effects on soil flux from environmental drivers, such as water table depth, were observed between months, rather than hours and days. There were significant differences in the relationships between environmental variables and soil flux, depending on if soils had been recently disturbed or not. Area-weighted emissions based on microtopography gave a mean annual emissions factor of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 standard error) from this peatland use.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nGlobally, peatlands cover approximately 420 million ha, equivalent to 2.8% of the world land area. Of this area, approximately 44-170 million ha are found in the tropics, with an estimated tropical peatland carbon (C) pool of 81.7-91.9 Gt C. The C rich soils in peatlands are formed from long-term accumulation of dead plant material, preserved under anaerobic conditions due to high water table levels. Land use change in peatlands results in significant C losses to the atmosphere, principally due to drainage leading to microbial decomposition of the soil C, aquatic export of dissolved and particulate organic C, and methane emissions from drainage channels. Of the total area of tropical peatlands, it is estimated that approximately 24.2 Mha are degraded, with a loss of 1.48 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> per year.\n\nWhile the Congo Basin in central Africa has the most extensive peatland complex on the continent [and the most extensive in the tropics], neighbouring Uganda is the largest contributor to emissions from degrading peat in Africa, where at least 0.5 Mha of Uganda\u2019s estimated 1.3 Mha of peatland has been degraded, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of up to 20 Mt yr<sup>-1</sup>. However, there is limited research into the use of peat soils in Uganda, and the impacts of peatland degradation on soil C and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics.\n\nAcross Uganda wetland types vary, and can be found fringing lakes, in lowland plains and in valley bottoms. Vegetation found in these wetlands are diverse and include grassland, *Cyperus papyrus*, woodlands, and palms, with plants either anchored into the soil or floating on the water\u2019s surface. These wetland areas are where Uganda\u2019s peat soils are found. While the extent of peat soils across the country is still to be fully documented, they are often found underpinning papyrus-dominated wetland areas, in particular in the SW of the country. The valley bottom wetlands of the Kigezi highlands close to the border with Rwanda have some of the deepest reported peat deposits of all of Uganda, but the most widespread wetland drainage and land use change occurs here as well. Wetland conversion is largely due to agricultural drivers, with cultivation of potatoes on these peat soils estimated to provide income of US$ 3,000 \u00b1 1,000 ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> to smallholder farmers.\n\nWhile the key environmental drivers affecting GHG emissions from soils have been documented in many studies and indicate strong relationships between temperature, water table depth (WTD) and soil respiration flux, there is limited understanding of these relationships for the diversity of conditions found across tropical peatlands. It is important to highlight the need to differentiate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from heterotrophic respiration during microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (R<sub>h</sub>) and the emissions from roots and autotrophs which is not a result of soil carbon loss, The majority of tropical peatland emissions research has been conducted in SE Asia, and to a lesser extent in the Amazon basin, but there are considerable gaps when it comes to understanding the range and biogeochemistry of C losses experienced by these drained peatlands under the diversity of land use changes and wetland conditions occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. At an ecosystem level the work of Saunders et\u00a0al. identified reductions in ecosystem C due to agricultural conversion in wetlands in Uganda based on measurements of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, but how much soils contribute to overall carbon loss from these systems is unknown.\n\nFor these reasons, this study set out to understand the biogeochemistry and rates of C losses from peat soils under land use change, through measurement of heterotrophic CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from a potato cultivated peatland in a deep peat wetland system in SW Uganda. The key objectives of this were to quantify the potential range of soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes associated with this land use change on this soil, identify if there is temporal variability in these CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, and identify any relationships between soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and key environmental variables.\n\n# 2 Methods\n\nThis study was implemented in the catchment of the Ruhuma wetland system in Muko Sub-county, Kabale District, in the Kigezi Highlands of south western Uganda (-1.208752\u00b0 latitude, 29.830968\u00b0 longitude, approximately 1,900 m above sea level). The landscape comprises of steep mineral soil hillsides which slope into a minerotrophic wetland valley bottom. The entire landscape is a mosaic of small, privately cultivated plots, with those in the wetland managed under farmer cooperatives, and individual plots distributed between farmers, most of whom manage multiple plots.\n\nThe Ruhuma wetland system is part of a network of peat dominated, valley bottom wetlands in the area, located 35\u00a0km SW of Kabale town, where the river Ruhuma flows north out of Lake Bunyonyi. The wetland covers approximately 5.47 km<sup>2</sup>, at an altitude of 1,930 m above sea level. Wetland edge cultivation began in the 1980s and by the late 1990s the majority of the wetland was drained and converted for cultivation (personal communication). Peat depths in this wetland are significant, with measurements in the site indicating depths of over 10\u00a0m (personal data), and other studies measuring peat depths of over 20\u00a0m in neighbouring wetlands. The sapric peat soils found in this wetland are highly organic, with average organic matter contents measured at 87.22 \u00b1 3.9% [\u00b1 SD, n=198] and bulk densities averaging 0.125 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0g cm<sup>3</sup> [\u00b1 SD, n=835].\n\nIn order to determine the range and temporal variability in fluxes from peat soils under potato cultivation we measured CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at daily, weekly and monthly timesteps. To capture the weekly and monthly variability, we conducted four sets of repeated 5-day morning (between 9.00 and 11.00) and afternoon (between 15.00 and 17.00) measurements on thirty randomly located paired collars (15 on raised beds and 15 on adjacent trenches) within a potato field. In addition to this, on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of each sampling period we added sampling at 18.00, 21.00 and 24.00, and 5.00 and 12.00 the following day, with the intention of capturing diurnal variability in temperatures and emissions. In order to determine the relationships between soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and key environmental variables, soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, soil and air temperatures, WTD were all recorded *in situ* from each collar for every measurement. Measurements were all conducted from within the same farmer\u2019s field in an area under management by the Rurigita Farmer\u2019s Cooperative of the Ruhuma wetland.\n\nWhen preparing the experimental design we were limited by the lack of available land use information, in particular around how the soils were used over the year. We targeted our sampling campaigns as best as possible towards capturing the potential difference in environmental and management conditions that the soils would experience over the year. Measurements were taken at the end of the rainy season in May 2014 when wetland soils were dug in preparation for planting of potatoes, in the dry season in August 2014 during the potato growing season, in the rainy season in November 2014 after the harvest at the start of the fallow period, and in February 2015 during the dry season and fallow period prior to the next season of planting. Farmers digging of the potato beds in May involved the clearing of fallow weeds into the old trenches between old, raised beds, and then piling the soil from the previous year\u2019s beds into these trenches. Once the old bed had been transferred into the old trench, further digging down into fresher peat brought up previously unexposed soil which was piled on top of the new beds. After approximately 48 hours these new beds were planted with rows of potatoes. Potatoes grew for approximately 3.5 months, when they were harvested for market with the onset of the new rainy season in September. After harvesting, beds were left fallow until the following June, when the cycle of mining and mounding fresh peat to create new beds was repeated."} 
{"question": "What factors contributed to the significant differences in soil CO2 emissions between raised beds and trenches?", "answer": "The significant differences in soil CO2 emissions between raised beds and trenches were influenced by microtopographical differences, as indicated by the t-test results (p<0.005).

Additionally, environmental variables such as soil and air temperatures, as well as water table depth (WTD), varied between these microtopographies, further contributing to the differences in soil respiration rates.", "context": "Collars made from PVC piping 10\u00a0cm in diameter and 5\u00a0cm in height were fully inserted into the soil. Care was taken to place collars away from any plants and they were checked on removal at the end of each sampling period to ensure no plant roots were present. These collars remained *in situ* for each 5-day set of samples and were then removed and randomly placed for the next month\u2019s sampling. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were sampled using a PP Systems EGM-4 with a SRC-1 Soil Respiration Chamber placed onto the collars. Chamber measurements were set to run for up to 120 seconds. The WTD was recorded using a tape-measure and pre-prepared dip-well near to each pair of collars, and soil and air temperature were recorded during each flux measurement using digital thermometers with a 0.1\u00b0C resolution.\n\nAll data analysis was conducted in R Studio v 1.4.1106 using R v 4.0.4.\u00a0A linear function was applied to the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> recorded for each measurement and data was then converted into flux based on the following equation:\n\n$$\n{R}_h=(S\\times (\\frac{P}{1000})\\times (\\frac{273}{273+T})\\times (\\frac{40.01}{22.41})\\times (\\frac{V}{A}))/1000\\times 3600 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere *R*<sub>h</sub> was the rate of efflux (g m<sup>-2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>), *S* was the slope of the concentration increase during the measurement (ppm s<sup>-1</sup>), *P* was the pressure in the chamber (mBar, recorded by the EGM), *T* was the soil temperature (\u00b0C), *V* was the chamber volume (0.001171 m<sup>3</sup>), and *A* was the collar area (0.0078 m<sup>2</sup>). The ratio $\\frac{40.01}{22.41}$ accounts for the area occupied by one kg mol of CO<sub>2</sub> at standard temperature and pressure. Division by 1,000 and multiplication by 3,600 converts kg to g and seconds to hours.\n\nMean results are presented with either standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), as noted in the results. T-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare results, along with Tukey\u2019s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Linear models were developed based on log transformed R<sub>h</sub>. We explored a series of linear models for R<sub>h</sub> and WTD, soil temperature and soil management (raised beds, trenches and recent disturbance). Regression models were further improved with the log transformation of the R<sub>h</sub>.\n\n# 3 Results\n\nOver 1,300 soil flux measurements were taken as part of this study. We observed a significant difference in the rate of soil flux from the raised beds (referred to as raised beds, n=648), compared to the narrow drainage trenches between them (referred to as trenches, n=653, t-test, p<0.005, **Table\u00a01**), and as such all results are split based on this micro-topographical difference. Across all samples, the mean heterotrophic respiration (R<sub>h</sub>) emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from the raised beds was 1.39 \u00b1 0.6\u00a0g m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SD) and from trenches was 0.22 \u00b1 0.1\u00a0g m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a01: Range in day time and night time results for soil and air temperatures and flux, from raised beds and trenches.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Diurnal (n measurements) & Soil temperature (\u00b0C, mean \u00b1 SD, min., max.) & Air temperature (\u00b0C, mean \u00b1 SD, min., max.) & R<sub>h</sub> (g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>, mean \u00b1 SD, min., max.) \\\\\n \\midrule\n Raised beds & Day time (575) & 19.2 \u00b1 1.1, 16.4, 23.7 & 22.7 \u00b1 4.1, 14.0, 34.0 & 1.381 \u00b1 0.6, 0.546, 3.971 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Night time (73) & 19.6 \u00b1 1.1, 17.3, 22.0 & 12.9 \u00b1 1.9, 10.0, 17.0 & 1.529 \u00b1 0.6, 0.552, 3.307 \\\\\n \\hline\n Trenches & Day time (587) & 18.4 \u00b1 0.8, 16.2, 20.7 & 22.8 \u00b1 4.1, 14.0, 32.0 & 0.228 \u00b1 0.1, 0.019, 0.856 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Night time (66) & 18.8 \u00b1 0.5, 17.6, 20.0 & 13.0 \u00b1 1.9, 10.0, 17.0 & 0.187 \u00b1 0.1, 0.035, 0.541 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T1}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n## 3.1 Range in Soil Respiration Fluxes and Environmental Variables\n\nAcross all measurements, the minimum air temperature recorded was 10 \u00b0C, and the maximum was 34 \u00b0C. Day time air temperatures (taken in day light hours; i.e. between 7.00 and 19.00) ranged between a minimum of 14 \u00b0C to a maximum of 34\u00a0\u00b0C, compared to night time measurements which were limited to 10-17 \u00b0C. Across all measurements the minimum soil temperature was 16.2 \u00b0C and the maximum 23.7 \u00b0C. Soil temperatures did not show such a change between day to night conditions, with almost identical mean temperatures reported for daytime and night-time results per micro-topographical class (**Table\u00a01**). Mean R<sub>h</sub> was higher in the night than in the day from the raised beds, whereas from the trenches it was lower. Measured WTDs varied between 21\u00a0cm and 81\u00a0cm below the soil surface of the raised beds, and between 2\u00a0cm above and 52\u00a0cm below the soil surface of the trenches.\n\n## 3.2 Temporal Variability\n\n### 3.2.1 Daily\n\nAcross the entire dataset, separated for raised beds and trenches, we found that there was no significant difference in the R<sub>h</sub> measured from the raised beds between the sampling times of day (ANOVA, p=0.27, **Figure\u00a01**). In the trenches a significant difference in R<sub>h</sub> was found between morning and midnight measurements and the morning and measurements taken in the 15.00 to 17.00 time period (ANOVA, Tukey\u2019s HSD, p<0.005). Soil temperature on the raised beds and in the trenches was significantly different between the measurements earlier in the day (the morning and early afternoon measurements from 5.00 \u2013 14.00) compared with the higher later afternoon and night-time measurements (15.00 \u2013 1.00), potentially due to a lag time from daytime sun (p<0.001).\n\nAir temperature showed a significant reduction in temperature over the night-time sampling points (p<0.001).\n\n### 3.2.2 Day to Day\n\nUsing the regularly sampled morning and afternoon datasets, there was a significant difference between the means of some results when compared between the 5 days of sampling, with data grouped based on microtopography, month, and time of day that measurements were taken (ANOVA, with significance determined based on p value <0.05, using the regular morning and afternoon measurements, **Table\u00a02**). Soil and air temperature were the most frequently different variables between days. The WTD only varied significantly between days in November and February. There were no significant differences in the day-to-day R<sub>h</sub> measurements on raised beds, and only in the trenches in November and February, corresponding to the period of variation in the WTD.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a02: Occasions when there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in flux results across the 5 day measurement period per month, split for raised beds and trenches, and split into morning and afternoon measurements.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Microtopography & Month & Number of measurement days & AM soil temperature & PM soil temperature & AM air temperature & PM air temperature & AM water table depth & PM water table depth & AM R<sub>h</sub> measurements & PM R<sub>h</sub> measurements \\\\\n \\midrule\n Raised beds & May 2014 & 5 & * & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & August 2014 & 5 & & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & November 2014 & 5 & * & * & * & * & * & * & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & February 2015 & 5 (AM), 3 (PM) & * & * & & * & * & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n Trenches & May 2014 & 5 & * & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & August 2014 & 5 & & & * & & & & & \\\\\n \\hline\n & November 2014 & 5 & * & * & * & * & * & & * & * \\\\\n \\hline\n & February 2015 & 5 (AM), 3 (PM) & * & * & & * & * & * & * & \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T2}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n### 3.2.3 Month to Month\n\nMeasured environmental variables and R<sub>h</sub> varied significantly over the year between sampling occasions (p<0.05),; this allowed us to examine the difference between results from raised beds and the trenches using the regularly sampled morning and afternoon data (**Tables\u00a03**, **4**). Comparison between the four months found there were significant differences between most variables measured. In all months except November-May and November-August the WTD was significantly different between months in the raised beds, and across all months there was a significant difference between months in the WTD in the trenches. Soil temperatures were higher on the raised beds than trenches, and were significantly different between almost all months. Average daytime air temperature each month was between 20 and 25 \u00b0C, and varied significantly between almost all months.

Disturbance was due to digging of the peat for preparation of the raised beds (in May 2014), and from the potato harvest prior to flux sampling in November. At the undisturbed sampling times we saw a significant relationship between the WTD and R<sub>h</sub> (p<0.001, adjusted r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.77) and a strong relationship between the soil temperature and R<sub>h</sub> although with high variability (p<0.001, adjusted r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.07). For the measurements taken when the soil in the raised beds had been recently disturbed these relationships were no longer significant (p>0.3, adjusted r<sup>2 =</sup> 0, **Figure\u00a02**).\n\nThe log transformation of the R<sub>h</sub> further strengthened our regression models. Across the regularly sampled data there was a significant relationship between WTD and logR<sub>h</sub> (linear model, p<0.001, **Table\u00a05** equation (a)), with 81% of the total variance explained by the model (adjusted r<sup>2</sup>). Soil temperature also showed a significant relationship (linear model, p<0.001, **Table\u00a05** equation (b)), but had a lower proportion of the total variance explained by the model (adjusted r<sup>2</sup> of 0.23). Linear regression of the logR<sub>h</sub> with WTD and soil temperature showed a significant relationship and 82% of the total variance explained by the model (**Table\u00a05**, equation (c)).\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a05: Linear models for soil and water table depth, for the regularly sampled morning and afternoon data and for when the data is split based on disturbance (i.e. disturbed data is from raised beds in May and November sampling occasions).}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Variables & Equation & Significance \\\\\n \\midrule\n WTD & Equation a:log R<sub>h</sub>= -2.21016-0.03812(WTD) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.81RMSE=0.46 \\\\\n \\hline\n Soil temperature & Equation b:log R<sub>h</sub>= -9.50964+0.46950(T<sub>s</sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.23RMSE=0.69 \\\\\n \\hline\n WTD and soil temperature & Equation c:log R<sub>h</sub>= -6.73021 - 0.01364(WTD) + 0.24705(T<sub>s</sub>)+0.00359(WTD \u00d7 T<sub>s</sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.82RMSE=0.46 \\\\\n \\hline\n Regression model with WTD and disturbance & Equation d: *For disturbed soils*:log R<sub>h</sub>= -1.72578-0.03355(WTD) *For undisturbed soils*:log R<sub>h</sub> = -2.131514 -0.03355(WTD) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.83RMSE=0.40 \\\\\n \\hline\n Regression model with soil temperature and disturbance & Equation e: *For disturbed soils:*log R<sub>h</sub> = -3.3214+0.19291(T<sub>s</sub>) *For undisturbed soils:*log R<sub>h</sub> = -4.6571 + 0.19291(T<sub>s</sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.47RMSE=0.52 \\\\\n \\hline\n Regression model with WTD, soil temperature and disturbance & Equation f: *For disturbed soils*:log R<sub>h</sub>= -6.74386-0.13275(WTD)+ 0.27674(T<sub>s</sub>)+0.00537(WTD \u00d7 T<sub>s</sub>) *For undisturbed soils*:log R<sub>h</sub>= -7.213513 -0.13275(WTD)+ 0.27674(T<sub>s</sub>)+ 0.00537(WTD \u00d7 T<sub>s</sub>) & p<0.001r<sup>2 =</sup> 0.84RMSE=0.39 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T5}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nIncluding the effect of disturbance, there was a significant relationship in the regressions of logR<sub>h</sub> with WTD, with soil temperature and with both WTD and soil temperature (p<0.001, **Table\u00a05** equations (d), (e), (f)). Total variance explained was highest in the regression of logR<sub>h</sub> with WTD, soil temperature and disturbance (adjusted r<sup>2</sup> of 0.84, **Table\u00a05**), and the best fit between predicted and actual values was also in this model (RMSE = 0.39, **Table\u00a05** equation (f)).\n\n## 3.4 Area Weighed Emissions\n\nThe average width of the raised beds was 1.31 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0m (\u00b1 SE) and the average width of the trenches was 0.39 \u00b1 0.1m. Taking into account the size of the study field, this is equivalent to 77 \u00b1 4% (\u00b1 SE) under raised beds and 23 \u00b1 0.3% (\u00b1 SE) under trenches. Taking the mean from all R<sub>h</sub> measurements, 1.397 \u00b1 0.02\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SE) from the raised beds and 0.225 \u00b1 0.005\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SE) from the trenches and area-weighing them based on the measured field dimensions provides a mean hourly emissions rate of 1.128 \u00b1 0.019\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>, equivalent to a mean annual emissions rate of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (\u00b1 SE). While this annual loss estimate is simply based on the means of our measurements, future studies can refine this value through capturing further detail on environmental variables and soil use over the year.\n\n# 4 Discussion\n\n## 4.1 Range\n\nThe peat soils in this study site were a strong contributor to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Due to the mounding of soil to make the raised beds, the raised beds had a thicker layer of soil above the WTD than the trenches and thus showed significantly different rates of soil C loss with area weighed emissions from raised beds on average 10 times higher than from trenches per hectare across each month. While the mean hourly rate of R<sub>h</sub> from the trenches were nearly an order of magnitude lower than on the raised beds, they were still significant and comparable with those from other studies when considering a similar concept to the commonly applied micro-topographical classification of hummocks and hollows in peatland soils research. Jauhiainen et\u00a0al., 2005 presented a range of hollow flux measurements between 0.1-0.9\u00a0g m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> from a tropical forest floor with WTD of 0 to -30\u00a0cm, of which our average monthly range in R<sub>h</sub> from the trenches sits at the lower end of, between 0.16 to 0.27\u00a0g m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> with a WTD of -9 to -28\u00a0cm.\n\nComparison with other literature from the African continent is difficult due to a lack of heterotrophic emissions studies on cultivated peat soils. Were et\u00a0al. reported CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from an intact, waterlogged wetland in eastern Uganda, with mean CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes reported to be between 2.4-2.5\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> across different wetland vegetation types. This rate of flux is higher than we measured, but is assumed to include autotrophic respiration which our study does not. Carbon dioxide emissions from a cultivated Kenyan wetland (although not strictly R<sub>h</sub> as cut stems and roots were still present in collars) reported an approximate maximum of 0.3\u00a0g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> which was at the lower end of our measured emissions, but was not on peat soils (organic carbon content < 5%).\n\n## 4.2 Temporal Variability"} 
{"question": "What factors contribute to the high emissions of CO2 from peat soils under potato cultivation in Uganda compared to other regions?", "answer": "The high emissions of CO2 from peat soils under potato cultivation in Uganda are primarily due to the annual disturbance of the soil, which involves digging up new peat to create raised beds. This exposes previously waterlogged soils to aerobic conditions, leading to increased decomposition and CO2 emissions. Unlike oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, where soils are typically not disturbed post-planting, the repeated cultivation for potatoes maintains high emissions. Additionally, the management practices such as mounding of fresh peats and the resulting microtopography of raised beds and trenches significantly impact the rate of R<sub>h</sub>.", "context": "While we observed a significant reduction in air temperature overnight, this was not reflected in the soil temperatures, which showed an increase in temperature into the night with any early morning cooling of the soils still within the range of daytime soil temperatures. The R<sub>h</sub> also exhibited little to no difference over the day and night-time measurements- indicating that variability in R<sub>h</sub> over a diurnal time frame is not a significant consideration in this site. This is likely to be due to no changes in WTD overnight (the variable that exhibited the strongest influence on emissions), and no soil cooling overnight (in fact a mean 0.4\u00b0C increase in nocturnal soil temperatures in both the raised beds and trenches across all measurements). This contrasts with other studies that describe higher soil temperatures and R<sub>h</sub> during the middle of the day. Other studies have observed lower diurnal temperatures compared to daytime measurements, and applied correction factors to adjust daytime flux measurements based on Q<sub>10</sub>. Instead, we saw a much stronger difference in the month-to-month observations, in both the measured environmental variables and the R<sub>h</sub>.\n\nThere are no comparative R<sub>h</sub> studies for drained peat soils within Uganda, and so comparison of our estimated annual emissions from these soils can only be done against tropical peats from other countries. Based on the area weighing of our measurements, our annual estimate of emissions from these peat soils of 98.79 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (SE) is within the higher range of emissions compared to other tropical peat fluxes. Southeast Asia provides a strong set of measurements from drained peatlands, in particular under oil palm plantations. Fluxes from SE Asia are highly variable, with an Rh of 18-56 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1 in drained forest and oil palm in Malaysia, 74-111\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> from a range of studies on drained oil palm plantations in SE Asia, and 24.9\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in a young oil palm plantation in Borneo. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions factor for drained cropland and fallow in the tropics is 51\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. By comparison, peatlands under arable cropping in Europe, which involves annual ploughing of soils, have been shown to emit between 24-92\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The management of peat soils in Uganda under potato cultivation involves an annual refreshment of the exposed peat from digging up of new peat to create new raised beds, thus exposing previously waterlogged soils to aerobic conditions. This introduction of fresh peat on an annual basis is different to the soil management of oil palm plantations in SE Asia where the soils are typically not disturbed post-planting. Therefore, it might be expected that the peat soils under repeated cultivation for potatoes would have emissions that remain high, unlike in sites that are not disturbed again after the initial planting period where emissions reduce after initial years since drainage [e.g. in where the initial emissions of 91\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> dropped to 47\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> over the first 6 years].\n\n## 4.3 Environmental variables\n\nThe relationships observed between WTD, soil temperature and R<sub>h</sub> were not unexpected, as this has previously been demonstrated in multiple studies. In some studies, this has been presented as a linear relationship with WTD or soil temperature only. As water table depth measurements do not require technical equipment, the relationship observed here has the potential for wide use by a variety of stakeholders to evaluate and model the impacts of hydrological management within these systems for reduced carbon losses.\n\nWhile we observed strong relationships in the soils which had not recently experienced disturbance, we had more varied and higher R<sub>h</sub> from the soils that had. Disturbance could cause changes to soil microbial and environmental properties, and has implications for future studies on these soils which need to take these impacts into account, especially when attempting to determine annual change. Other variables not measured here such as changes in soil bulk density, may have a significant combined effect on R<sub>h</sub> and will vary as a result of soil management over the year. There may also be an effect of the location of microbial biomass in the soil profile, which have been shown to be more prolific in the upper layers of the soil, with microbial extracellular enzymes involved in C cycling reducing with depth.\n\nDue to a lack of literature and available information on the use of these peat soils under this land use prior to our study, our sampling frequency was based on attempting to capture the range of environmental and management conditions that we anticipated would be experienced over the year. Considering that these soils are dug, cultivated, planted, harvested and fallowed at different times over a 12-month period, each of which bring different impacts to the soil, as well as differences in WTD and temperatures over the year, further studies should consider this when planning sampling and modelling of soil C losses. While our study succeeded in capturing different management and WTD conditions over the year, future studies could consider increased sampling intensity to a monthly emissions sampling campaign to ensure the extent of land management impacts are captured. Inclusion of regular soil sampling with these monthly measurements, in particular for bulk density and organic matter content, would enable further analysis of soil change and further refinement of relationships with key variables, and feed into model development and application for estimating land use impacts on these soils. Capturing the spatial variability from cultivated peatlands across the Kigezi highlands would strengthen the estimates of soil C losses for this peatland type and land use. Measurements of continuous *in-situ* WTD, soil and air temperature, and soil moisture content along with local climate data, would allow for accurate modelling of emissions over the longer term.\n\n## 4.4 Implications for Peatland Management\n\nIn terms of land management impacts and mitigation strategies, initial insight from this study shows considerable soil C losses due to soil drainage and disturbance. Although a number of years have passed since our field study was conducted, these management practices continue and thus these soil carbon losses are still relevant. Efforts to raise water levels would reduce these losses- one low-impact option for farmers could include the transfer of raised bed soils into trenches at the end of the harvest, to allow waterlogging of these soils during the fallow period. Alternatively, re-wetting and restoration of the wetland and exploration of alternative ecosystem service provision (including C payments for avoided emissions) or improved upland soil and crop management for enhanced incomes (and thus reduced household dependency on wetland cultivation) should also be explored.

{"question": "How do root border cells (RBCs) contribute to plant resistance against aluminum (Al) toxicity?", "answer": "Root border cells (RBCs) contribute to plant resistance against aluminum (Al) toxicity by forming a protective barrier around the root tip, which helps to reduce the toxic effects of Al.

Additionally, RBCs can release various substances that regulate rhizosphere interactions and protect the root from mechanical damage and pathogen invasion.", "context": "Root Border Cells as a Convenient Single Cell System to Study Plant-Environmental Interactions: A Case Study for Aluminum Tolerance\n==============\n\nYingming Feng ,Xingyun Chen ,Xuewen Li ,Yalin Li ,Wei Nong ,Jiao Tang ,Hongxiang Han ,Lei Shi ,Sergey Shabala ,Min Yu\n\n# Abstract\n\nRoot border cells (RBCs) are a group of cells that originated from the root cap meristem, which are developed by genetic regulation and play a variety of biological functions. Being composed of a homologous single cell population with high metabolic activity and intact cell walls, RBCs represent a highly useful tool for studying various aspects of plant mineral absorption and utilization, as well as plant-soil-microbiome interactions in the rhizosphere. Research on RBCs also promise to become a hotspot in the context of understanding root adaptive responses to hostile environments. In order to take advantage of RBCs as an ideal single cell system in plant-environmental interactions, we summarized the production and function of RBCs and built-up the methodology for RBCs culturing, purification, and quantity control for plant research. The latter is done by using a case study of the application of RBCs to study mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants. This work offers plant scientists a new cognition of adopting RBCs as a convenient single cell system for the multidisciplinary research including (but not limited to) plant physiology, development and genetics, nutrition, and stress and adaptation. Root border cells (RBCs) are derived from the root cap and represent a population of living cells with special physiological activity and biological roles that are different from the root cap cells *per se*. After being separated from the root cap, RBCs become more active in metabolism than the progenitor root cap cells; for example, they incorporate labeled amino acids into protein 2.6-fold more efficiently than the cells of the root cap. In addition, mRNA and protein were differentially expressed between root cap cells and RBCs. Since the production of RBCs is genetically regulated and RBCs played a variety of biological functions in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses occurred in the rhizosphere, RBCs were suggested as an ideal single cell system for the study the response of plant root cells to nutrient availability, environmental stresses, and in plant-microbial interactions. Some studies revealed that RBCs, which development is regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals, are biologically viable in the majority of higher plant species. This work reviews the research on RBCs in plant environment interaction and describes the case study of RBCs as a convenient single cell system to study plant responses to Al toxicity.\n\n# 1 Production of RBCs and its Advantages as Plant Single Cell Line\n\n## 1.1 Production of RBCs\n\nRBCs are a group of specialized cells that dissociate from the epidermis of the root cap and gather around the root tip, which were previously called sloughed root cap cells. As early as 1919, Knudson had pointed out that some sloughed root cap cells were metabolically active; however, this had not attracted much attention from researchers at that time. In fact, more than 90% of the sloughed root cap cells in most species are alive, and their development is genetically regulated and shown to maintain\u00a0a variety of biological functions even under adverse conditions. Hawes redefined these cells as RBCs, due to that they are located between the root surface and the soil, and emphasized that these cells were bioactive biotic boundary layers.\n\nRoot cap cells differentiate from root cap meristem through mitosis, and then go through a series of developmental stages such as starch synthesis stage, gravity sensing stage, and mucilage secretion stage to produce RBCs. The separation of border cells is the final stage of root cap cell development, and the total number of RBCs don\u2019t increase indefinitely but tends to saturate. For example, during seed germination, the number of RBCs is positively correlated with the root elongation, but when the root length reaches about 2.5cm, the number of RBCs reaches the maximum value.\n\nThe efficiency of RBCs production differs among species. Based on\u00a0the previous studies, we analyzed the proportion of RBCs from 11 families that contains nearly 30 different species. The number and viability of RBCs are different not only among plant families, but also within one family. The RBCs number varies greatly among different plant families, ranging from 20 in *Solanaceae* to ~12,000 in *Leguminou*s (**Figure\u00a01**; ). As shown in **Figure\u00a01**, RBCs number also varies greatly within one family, e.g. from about 5,000 in soybean ( *Glycine Max*) up to 12,000 in pea ( *Pisum sativum*). The environmental factors such as metal ions, the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2,</sub> etc., also affect the production of RBCs. For example, the RBCs number increased from approximately 10,000 per root tip in the control to 12,000 after Al exposure (**Figure\u00a01**; ). **Figure\u00a01** and **Table\u00a01** list the range of RBCs number among families and species affected by different metal ions. There is little doubt that RBCs function essentially at least among these plant species and respond actively to environmental signals especially stresses. Therefore, they represent natural homologous root cell lines that may be used in studying various aspects of plant-environmental interactions.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a01: RBCs in the Study of Metal Toxicity.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n \\toprule\n Metals & References & Effect \\\\\n \\midrule\n \\multirow{7}{*}{Al toxicity} & Yu et\u00a0al.

It has been reported that RBCs can quickly release antibiotics, specific enzymes, sugars, and other chemicals to regulate the growth of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes around the rhizosphere by changing gene expression under stress. Some scientists also called the RBCs as root extracellular traps (RET) and their associated secretions form a protective structure, which plays a major role in the interaction between roots and soil-borne microorganisms. In addition, as RBCs separation from root tip proceeds, the cells synthesize and secrete a hydrated mucilage that contains polysaccharides, secondary metabolites, antimicrobial proteins and extracellular DNA (exDNA), and this exDNA-based matrix seems to function in root defense in a way similar to that of recently characterized neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in mammalian cells. Therefore, the change of the rhizosphere can be communicated through the interaction between RBCs, various rhizosphere microorganisms, and toxic substances (such as Al toxicity), thereby generating practical significance.\n\nAt present, the role of RBCs in improving plant stress resistance, especially in resisting heavy metal ion toxicity, has become a new hotspot in the field of plant physiology. We summarized this research on the range of RBCs number in different families which were affected by metal stresses with the citation lists in **Figure\u00a01**. Among these studies, more attention was paid to Al toxicity. Under Al stress, the elongation of the root is significantly inhibited in a few minutes, and the root tip is the main target of Al stress sensing and toxicity. However, the most sensitive zone to Al toxicity is not the root cap and meristem, but root transition zone, a zone 2-3\u00a0mm away from the root tip. RBCs, produced and gathered around the root cap and meristem (**Figure\u00a02**), were assumed to not only prevent the protruding root tip from mechanical damage, but also act as a protective barrier for the root tip to absorb Al. When the Al concentration increased to 200 \u00b5M, the thickness of the adhesive layer exuded by RBCs increased, reducing the toxic effect of Al on roots. In addition, the removal of RBCs leads to the increase of Al absorption by root tip. As shown in **Figure\u00a02**, in-depth research on the response of RBCs *in situ* or *in vitro* to Al toxicity was carried out (which will be discussed later), indicating RBCs have been successfully applied in Al research and can be an example of RBCs as a highly convenient single cell system for the study of plant-rhizosphere interactions."} 
{"question": "What advantages do RBCs offer over protoplasts and other plant cell lines for studying Al toxicity and tolerance?", "answer": "RBCs offer several advantages over protoplasts and other plant cell lines for studying Al toxicity and tolerance. Firstly, RBCs have a complete cell wall, allowing for the study of nutrient and toxin transport through the cell wall and plasma membrane, which is not possible with protoplasts that lack cell walls. Secondly, RBCs can be easily collected and observed without complex instrumentation, unlike protoplasts that require enzymatic solutions and sophisticated techniques for isolation. Thirdly, RBCs respond consistently to chemicals and stresses due to their homogeneity, whereas protoplasts require cell-specific labeling for homogeneity. Lastly, RBCs and their mucilage can form a protective sheath that binds and sequesters Al, reducing its toxicity and absorption by roots, which is a critical aspect of studying Al stress physiology.", "context": "## 1.3 The Ideal Plant Single Cell System of RBCs\n\nAs a homologous single cell group with metabolic activity and complete cell wall, the discovery of RBCs provides a useful tool for studying many interesting research topics including (but not limited to) Al toxicity and tolerance, transport of nutrients and toxins through cell wall and plasma membrane, and a broad range of interactions (e.g. Si-Al, B-Al interaction) in the cell wall matrix. As RBCs are naturally produced in root tips of a large number of plant species, research on RBCs can reflect the real events that occurred in root tips, and the results are more reliable and applicable to root research in comparison to the other cell lines (e.g. suspension cells) or protoplast (without cell wall) and organelles (vacuoles), although they have other merits.\n\nThe second advantage is that RBCs can be acquired simply just by collection in water or solution, or even directly be wiped onto the glass slides for observation. It is well-known that the process of producing a new plant cell line generally takes a few years. The uniform population of protoplasts can be produced quicker (within several hours) but requires a prior optimization of the cocktail of enzymatic solution which is time consuming and may take months. Protoplasts are also highly artificial as they lack cell walls (and hence many wall-anchored proteins) as well as have non-physiological resting membrane potential values that questions applicability of findings on protoplasts to explain planta responses. There are no other plant tissues that can be distinguished and dissected so easily without any complex instrumentation and isolation processes. Also, RBCs can survive for a long time in a large osmotic potential range including distilled water without disintegration or visible cell damage.\n\nAnother advantage is the homogeneity of the RBCs that responds consistently to the chemicals, stresses, or signals which has a great advantage over root heterogeneity as cells from different root zones (root caps, meristem, transition, elongation, and mature zones) function and respond differently. Protoplasts derived from a specific cell type also possess this feature but creating a homogenous protoplast population may require cell-specific fluorescent labeling and the use of highly expensive and sophisticated techniques (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Most critically, lacking cell walls, protoplasts cannot be used to study the response of whole single cells to chemicals, stresses, and signals in the apoplast limiting their applicability in stress physiology.\n\nLast but not the least, previous studies have shown that the RBCs and their mucilage could form a protective sheath at the root tip, which prevented Al from diffusing into the root tip, thereby alleviating Al stress in plant root tip. The mucilage consists of a variety of molecules including cell wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans, secondary metabolites, anti-microbial proteins and peptides, and extracellular DNA. Mucilage can strongly bind Al in the rhizosphere. The mucilage can protect root tips from Al toxicity by tightly binding Al and sequestrating Al in mucilage, which consequently reduced the inhibition of root growth induced by Al and the absorption of Al by roots. Therefore, RBCs are considered to be the front of plant response and defense to stresses. Considering RBCs are easier to be harvested in large quantities and easily purified, they are widely used in studies on Al toxicity. Of specific interest is pea ( *Pisum sativum*) - Mendel\u2019s model genetic material that are capable to produce up to 10,000 RBCs from one root tip.\n\n# 2 Methodological Aspects of RBCs Production and Use: A Case Study for Al Response and Tolerance\n\n## 2.1 Production of RBCs\n\n### 2.1.1 Modified Solid Media Culture\n\nPea seeds are generally germinated in a Petri dish with sterilized 1.0% agar, and then a small amount of RBCs derived from the pea roots is harvested for further analysis. If required, the chemicals can be applied to the agar preparation. To maximize the cell yield, the growth procedure was modified as follows. Firstly, pea seeds are soaked in 0.1-2.0 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 10-48\u00a0h after sterilization in 7.5% sodium-hypochlorite solution. Then, the fully soaked seeds are transferred to the solid agar using tweezers, and a layer of filter paper is put on the culture medium to prevent the root tip to penetrate the culture medium. The cells are then cultured in a 20-32\u00b0C incubator for 24-72\u00a0h (depending on plant growth rate) and collected when the root length reaches 1.0-5.0\u00a0cm. Cells can be collected by immersing root tips in water and gently rotating to detach the RBCs from the root. The solid media culture was previously widely used for pathology studies as it can be completely sterilized and can conveniently incorporate the treatment of microorganisms. However, it is difficult to count the number of RBCs since RBCs will fall off when they are touched during the sampling process, which affects the experimental results. Also, a large number of RBCs could be potentially obtained by cutting off many root tips (one by one) from plants grown in multiple Petri dishes. However, it is practically not feasible since it is time and labor-consuming and the viability of the RBCs will drop significantly if separated from the root tips for more than 3\u00a0h. So the modified solid media culture is most suitable for the research requiring a small amount of RBCs and studies that require strict sterility.\n\n### 2.1.2 Mist Culture\n\nMist culture was invented for the mass harvest of RBCs by Yu\u2019s group and it was found that mist culture could quickly collect a large number of RBCs with high metabolic activity. The method involves the use of a mist incubator (depicted in **Figure\u00a03**) composed of a sealed box to keep the humidity, a plastic mesh rack to support seeds, a mist generator to produce fine mist for seed germination, a timer to control the operation of the mist generator. Seeds are put on the mesh rack and a mist generator is regularly used to keep the humidity in the sealed box at a constant level to ensure the normal growth and development of seeds. The mist production is controlled by a timer with a 15 s spaying time and at the time interval of 5\u00a0min, which can ensure the humidity in the box of 98%, and the temperature is controlled at 22-24\u00b0C. Under the plant gravitropism, the germinated root tips are neatly distributed under the mesh. After the roots are elongated to 2-3\u00a0cm, the mesh rack can be removed from the sealed box and put into water to collect RBCs. In addition, during the culture process, the nutrient composition may be modified as per purpose of the experiment, and various signaling and chemical agents could be also dispersed by mist generator.\n\n### 2.1.3 Quality and Quantity Control of Harvested RBCs\n\nThe RBCs are generally harvested (or collected) in the solution of the same chemical composition as for germination (0.1-2.0 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Cells are then purified by centrifugation at a centrifugal force of less than 500 (\u00d7g) to 1-3 times depending on the experiment requirement. Then the viability and number of RBCs are generally checked under a microscope for the quality and quantity control of the RBCs for further research. Generally, the total number of the pelleted RBCs is used to control the next experiment under the same amount of cell numbers. Some of these issues are discussed in more detail in the case study of Al tolerance below.\n\n## 2.2 The Case Study of RBCs in Research of Al Tolerance\n\n### 2.2.1 The Detection of the Number and Viability of RBCs Under Al Stress\n\nIt is a direct method to study the response of RBCs to Al stress by detecting the cell activity or quantity/proportion of viable cells. The number of cells can be counted by hemocytometer or by visual microscopic observations. For activity detection, many methods have been used, such as FDA (Fluorescent Diacetate) - PI (Propidium Iodide) viability staining, TTC (Triphenylte-trazolium Chloride) staining and trypan blue exclusion staining. Trypan blue is a cell reactive dye, and is commonly used to detect the activity of RBCs. In a living cell, the intact cell membrane can prevent trypan blue from entering the cells, so it will not be stained. If the membrane integrity is broken, the dead cells will be stained in blue due. During the operation of the trypan blue exclusion method, the solution containing RBCs and 0.5% trypan blue staining solution is mixed at 1:1 (V/V) and stained in the dark for 15\u00a0min. The blue-stained cells are dead cells and the non-stained cells are living cells. The cell survival rate is calculated according to the distribution of cells of the two colors under the microscope. RBCs in the majority of species examined are >90% viable. However, RBCs separated from the\u00a0root\u00a0cap died within 24\u00a0h under Al<sup>3+</sup> stress while the *in vitro* RBCs maintained 85%\u00a0viability\u00a0at 48\u00a0h after treatment.\n\n### 2.2.2 Removing Extracellular Al Ions From RBCs"} 
{"question": "How do RBCs contribute to the study of aluminum (Al) toxicity and tolerance in plants?", "answer": "RBCs are used to study the absorption kinetics of specific ions, such as aluminum, by single cells. They provide insights into the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of Al toxicity at the cell level. RBCs help in understanding the interaction between cell walls and Al, which is crucial for Al accumulation and toxicity in plant root tips. Additionally, RBCs facilitate the study of biomineralization processes and the effects of Al stress on cell wall components, offering a direct method for screening Al-tolerant germplasm.", "context": "RBCs can also be used to study the absorption kinetics of specific ions by single cells. When RBCs are treated *in vitro*, some metal ions treated outside or secreted by cells are required to be removed because of the reaction conditions of each element in the cells to be determined, as to purify RBCs. Generally, two methods are frequently used; one is microporous membrane filtration, and the second one is purification by centrifugation. Microporous membrane purification uses a 0.4~5 \u00b5m filter membrane to purify cells. The advantage of this method is that it is fast, accurate, and will not wash off cells. However, the method comes with the danger of mechanically damaging cells thus affecting their operation and viability. The centrifugal purification method is gentler. RBCs are centrifugated with a centrifugal force of less than 500 (\u00d7g), and lots machines, such as ICP(Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer), can be used to measure the degree of extracellular Al washing of each cell. The extracellular Al is completely removed after the 3-4 times centrifugation.\n\n### 2.2.3 Changes of Cell Wall Components of RBCs Under Al Stress\n\nThe cell wall is in the outermost layer of the cell. As the initial part of Al contact, it is the first barrier for plants to deal with Al stress, both the initial site of Al toxicity, and the main part of Al accumulation. The accumulation of Al in the cell wall is a prerequisite for the toxicity of Al to plant root tips. Pectin in the cell wall can promote the tolerance of plants to Al by regulating its distribution, so the combination of Al and cell wall polysaccharides plays an important role in the expression of Al toxicity and tolerance in plants. In the analysis of cell wall components, The extraction of cell wall and the separation of cell wall polysaccharide components were carried out according to Takayuki etal.. The total sugar of cell wall can be determined by the phenol-sulfuric\u00a0acid\u00a0method based on glucose; uronic acid is determined by pyrocatechol colorimetry; and pectin content is analyzed and determined according to the method of Li etal.. Through the study of the interaction between cell wall and Al, the experimental conditions for the tolerance of root border cells to Al ion stress were established and optimized, so as to better study the physiological and biochemical mechanism of Al toxicity at the cell level and provide a direct method for the screening of Al tolerant germplasm in the future.\n\n### 2.2.4 Biomineralization of Al in RBCs\n\nThe biomineralization process of cell induced self-assembly to form nanostructures has been a great interest subject to biologists and material chemists for many years. It is a process in which a small number of organic macromolecules (polysaccharides, proteins, and glycoproteins) are used as templates for a molecular operation to control the nucleation and growth of mineral phases and combine them into inorganic materials in a highly orderly manner. Inspired by nature, many researchers imitate the sheath structure outside biological cells by physical, chemical, or biochemical methods, especially the chemical modification method, which is a technology to prepare polyelectrolyte multilayer coating by alternately depositing anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on the solid surface through electrostatic interaction. Among them, layer-by-layer self-assembly (LBL) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) induction technology are common chemical modification methods. In recent years, chemical modification methods have been applied to yeast cells and rice suspension cells. The results show that the deposition of nano silicon can inhibit the entry of Cd<sup>2+</sup> into cells and effectively alleviate cadmium toxicity. For RBCs, Feng etal. applied layer-by-layer self-assembly technology to pea RBCs, showing that nanosilicon can keep the mitochondrial function of RBCs normal under Al stress, reduce the burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and finally reduce the programmed cell death, so that RBCs can maintain high viability without significant difference from the control group. This mechanism is like the RBCs in response to Al toxicity described in **Figure\u00a02**. Briefly, nano silicon deposition confers cells with high Al resistance. In addition, *in situ* RBCs can be used to study the change of cell wall mechanical properties and cell ion homeostasis under Al stress. Thus, RBCs offer material scientists a new single cell system for studing biomineralization.\n\n# 3 Prospects\n\nThe use of RBCs provides significant competitive advantages for plant cell physiology research compared with the other plant cell lines or protoplast-based methods. Studies involving RBCs are becoming a hot spot in the research of developmental biology, plant nutrition, and plant-environmental interactions. Adopting RBCs in research of Al toxicity provides opportunities for understanding the mechanisms underlying Al tolerance making the use of the cutting edge techniques such as microelectrode ion flux estimation(MIFE). There is also an exciting possibility of utilizing RBCs in research on biomineralization. We believe that RBCs, as an ideal single cell system, may disclose more molecular mechanisms of the response of cells to surrounding signals, if taken in combination with modern molecular tools such as single cell omics techniques."} 
{"question": "What are the main drivers of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in different land utilization types in Western Kenya?", "answer": "The main drivers of soil GHG fluxes in different land utilization types in Western Kenya include soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. These factors influence the soil-atmosphere exchange of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) through complex biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification.", "context": "Soil greenhouse gas emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya\n==============\n\nEsphorn Kibet ,Collins M.

Kosgei ,Betty Mulianga ,Michael Okoti ,Abdirahman Zeila ,Felix Kipchirchir Ngetich\n\n# Abstract\n\n# Introduction\n\nThere is a vast data gap for the national and regional greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from different smallholder land utilization types in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at large. Quantifying soil GHG, i.e., methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from smallholder land utilization types, is essential in filling the data gap.\n\n# Methods\n\nWe quantified soil GHG emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya. We conducted a 26-soil GHG sampling campaign from the different land utilization types. The five land utilization types include 1) agroforestry M (agroforestry Markhamia lutea and sorghum), 2) sole sorghum (sorghum monocrop), 3) agroforestry L (Sorghum and Leucaena leucocephala), 4) sole maize (maize monocrop), and 5) grazing land.\n\n# Results and discussion\n\nThe soil GHG fluxes varied across the land utilization types for all three GHGs (p \u2264 0.0001). We observed the lowest CH4 uptake under grazing land (\u22120.35 kg CH4\u2013C ha\u22121) and the highest under sole maize (\u22121.05 kg CH4\u2013C ha\u22121). We recorded the lowest soil CO2 emissions under sole maize at 6,509.86 kg CO2\u2013Cha\u22121 and the highest under grazing land at 14,400.75 kg CO2\u2013Cha\u22121. The results showed the lowest soil N2O fluxes under grazing land at 0.69 kg N2O\u2013N ha\u22121 and the highest under agroforestry L at 2.48 kg N2O\u2013N ha\u22121. The main drivers of soil GHG fluxes were soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. The yield-scale N2O fluxes ranged from 0.35 g N2O\u2013N kg\u22121 under sole maize to 4.90 g N2O\u2013N kg\u22121 grain yields under agroforestry L. Nevertheless, our findings on the influence of land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes and yield-scaled N2O emissions are within previous studies in SSA, including Kenya, thus fundamental in filling the national and regional data of emissions budget. The findings are pivotal to policymakers in developing low-carbon development across land utilization types for smallholders farming systems.\n\n# Introduction\n\nSince industrialization, the global concentration of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes has risen. The upsurging population and the need for more food have led to land utilization intensification for improved crop production and heightened soil GHG emissions. Different land utilization types (LUTs) have varying soil GHG (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) fluxes potential. Through fertilizer, manure, and crop residues application, land utilization intensification could surge soil GHG fluxes in the quest for increased food production. Despite the GHG fluxes potential of different land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes, there is a lack of experimentally determined, smallholder-based data that can inform nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in most sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Kenya. Therefore, soil GHG fluxes measurements from common land utilization types among smallholder farmers in Kenya are essential to inform policy decisions and improve the National GHG reporting accuracy to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nSoil is a sink and source of soil GHG fluxes. The overall soil\u2013atmosphere exchange (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) results from oxidative and reductive reactions of soil C and N through complex biogeochemical processes, such as nitrification and denitrification. The soil\u2013atmosphere exchange across smallholder land utilization types is controlled by various soil physiochemical properties, including bulk density, soil organic carbon, nitrogen, pH, soil moisture, and soil temperature. For improved productivity, different land management practices, such as tillage and soil amendments, could trigger soil GHG fluxes. Climate factors, vegetation cover, and crop types across different utilization types significantly influence soil GHG fluxes. The diversified LUTs, such as grazed lands, agroforestry systems, and intensively managed croplands, increase the soil GHG gas uncertainty. The presence of leguminous trees increases GHG uncertainty. Despite the potential contribution of different land utilization types in the National GHG budget and in informing the NDCs in Kenya, there is limited availability of farm-level data.\n\n*Markhamia lutea* is a non-leguminous and evergreen tree belonging to the Bignoniaceae family. It is the most widespread tree species in Western Kenya and sequesters up to 65,000 kg C ha<sup>\u2212</sup>1 into the soil. Due to its economic viability, smallholder farmers use *Markhamia* in agroforestry systems. The amount of carbon input fixed by *Markhamia* could increase the substrate availability for microorganisms, thus increasing soil microbial activities. Additionally, the amount of C in the soil could increase bioturbation and exudation of soil organic matter triggering CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. *Leucaena leucocephala* is an evergreen and thornless tree belonging to the *Fabaceae* and *Mimosoideae* subfamily. *Leucaena* sp. accelerates nitrogen cycling, such as nitrification and denitrification. Leguminous trees could trigger emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O due to the high availability of N in the soil. Rosenstock et al. reported that leguminous trees input between 46 and 140\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> year<sup>\u22121</sup>. The amount of N is a function of C, thus the risk of accelerating GHG emissions. Therefore, soil GHG fluxes measurements from land utilization types managed by smallholders are essential\n\nThis study quantifies spatial and temporal GHG fluxes and yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from five land utilization types (LUTs) under smallholder farming conditions. The five LUTs were grazing field, sorghum monocrop, maize monocrop, and sorghum intercropped with agroforestry trees, i.e., *M. lutea* and *L. leucocephala*. We hypothesized that soil GHG fluxes in grazing land would be the highest due to continuous active root availability, animal droppings, and urine. In addition, integrating agroforestry trees into sorghum could increase crop yields and reduce yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\n## Study area\n\nWe conducted the soil GHG experimentation in a smallholder farm, with selected farm utilization types of interest, in Nyajuok sub-location, Siaya County, Western Kenya. The farm is at approximately 1,236 m above sea level and lies within the lower midland (LM1)\u2014\u201dsugarcane belt\u201d agroecological zone. It receives bimodal rainfall with long rain (LR) seasons from March to July and short rain (SR) from August to December. The annual rainfall ranges between 1,500 and 1,900 mm, and average annual temperatures of 21.80\u00b0C\u201320.9\u00b0C. The LR and SR season rainfall amounts range between 750 and 950\u00a0mm, and 600 and 800\u00a0mm, respectively. The highest temperatures are experienced from January to March. The area is suitable for maize ( *Zea mays*), sorghum ( *Sorghum bicolar*), common beans ( *Phaseolus vulgaris*), cowpeas ( *Vigna unguiculata*), sweet potatoes ( *Ipomoea batatas*), soya beans ( *Glycine max*), sunflower ( *Heliuthus annuus*), spinach ( *Spinacia oleracea*), and onions ( *Allium cepa*). The soil type is Ferralsols, with inherent low soil fertility. The low soil fertility constrains the implementation of cropping practices without amendments. The predominant primary land utilization types include grazing, agroforestry, maize, and sorghum.\n\n## Experimental setup and management\n\nThe study design was farmer designed and managed (Type III). The selection of the smallholder farm for field experimentation was informed by the existence of the five LUTs of interest (**Figure\u00a01**). The treatments (LUTs) had different dimensions: sole maize treatment measured 0.4\u00a0ha, grazing land measured 0.5\u00a0ha, while agroforestry M, sole sorghum, and agroforestry L measured 0.3\u00a0ha. The LUTs were (i) sorghum monocrop, (ii) sorghum-agroforestry\u2014 *M. lutea* (agroforestry M), (iii) sorghum-agroforestry *L. leucocephala* (agroforestry L), (iv) maize monocrop, and (v) grazing land. Under each LUT, we installed three PVCs circular static chambers to a 5-cm depth following Pelster et al.. The three static chambers were the replicates."} 
{"question": "What were the main challenges affecting sorghum yields during the experimental period?", "answer": "The main challenges affecting sorghum yields during the experimental period were flooding between March and May 2021 and infestation by the Striga weed (Striga hermonthica).", "context": "All field management practices during the experimental period were observed and recorded under all LUTs except grazing land (**Table\u00a01**). They included plowing, manure application, fertilization, planting, weeding, and harvesting. During the SR 20, land preparation was done using a tractor, followed by ox plowing. However, primary and secondary tillage was implemented using ox plow during the LR 21. Additionally, plant residue was retained in sole sorghum, agroforestry M, and agroforestry L during SR 21. Animal manure was incorporated 2 weeks before planting in each cropping season. Farmer applied manure (nitrogen content of 1.09% and carbon content of 26.2%) at 2\u00a0t (**Table\u00a01**), while inorganic fertilizer application was done during planting. The average amount of organic matter (OM) was 9.03%. For sorghum planting and fertilizer, diammonium phosphate (DAP, nitrogen content of 18%) applications were done on 14 August 2020 and 2 April 2021. The rate of DAP applied varied; during SR, the rate was 112\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (20.16\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), while during LR, the rate was 125\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (22.5\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), in the sole sorghum, agroforestry M, and agroforestry L. The sorghum spacing was 75\u00a0cm \u00d7 20\u00a0cm inter- and intra-rows, respectively. For maize planting and fertilizer, diammonium phosphate (DAP) application under the sole maize LUT was done on 7 September 2020 and 29 March 2021 at a rate of 125\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> DAP (22.5\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), during SR 20 and LR 21. The maize spacing was 75\u00a0cm (inter-rows) and 50\u00a0cm (intra-rows). Weed management was implemented twice during each cropping season using a hand hoe. Flooding in the sole sorghum, agroforestry M, and agroforestry L between March and May 2021, coupled with *Striga* weed ( *Striga hermonthica*) infestation, suppressed sorghum yields. The SR 20 was from July 2020 (harvest of the previous crop) to December 2020 (harvesting), while the LR 2020 ran from January 2021 (the following harvesting) to June 2021.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a01: Farm management practices in different land utilization types in Siaya County, Kenya.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n LUTs<sup>1</sup> & Land preparation & Fertilization & Weeding \\\\\n \\midrule\n Agroforestry M & Disk plowing with moldboard on 30 July 2020 ad ox plowing on 23 February 2021 & Manure broadcasting across the two seasons, 6 August 2020; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> and 524\u00a0kg C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), DAP 112\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (20\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) 14 April 2021; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg Nh a<sup>\u22121</sup>) DAP 125\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (22.5\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & 28 September 2020 and 30 April 2020 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole sorghum & Disk plowing 30 July 2020 and ox plowing 20 February 2021 & Manure broadcasting across the two seasons. 6 August 2020; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> and 524\u00a0kg C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), DAP 112\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (20.16\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), 14 April 2021; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) DAP 125\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (22.5\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & 28 September 2020 and 30 April 2020 \\\\\n \\hline\n Agroforestry L & Disk plowing on 30 July 2020 and ox plowing on 10 March 2021 & Manure broadcasting across the two seasons. 6 August 2020; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> and 524\u00a0kg C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), DAP 112\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (20\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), 14 April 2021; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), DAP 125\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (22.5\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & 30 September 2020 and 30 April 2020 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole maize & Ox plowing on 8 August 2020 and on 16 February 2021 & 14 September 2020; manure, 2\u00a0t ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (21.8\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> and 524\u00a0kg C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), DAP 112\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (20.16\u00a0kg N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>), 29 March 2021; manure & 2 October 2020 and 18 April 2020 \\\\\n \\hline\n Grazing land<sup>2</sup> & <sup>\u2013</sup> & <sup>\u2013</sup> & <sup>\u2013</sup> \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T1}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n## Soil GHG fluxes measurements and analysis\n\nThree PVC circular vented static chambers for soil GHG fluxes (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) sampling were in each LUT (**Figure\u00a01**) at the onset of the experiment. Each chamber was composed of a lid (diameter, 10\u00a0cm; height, 8cm) and a base (diameter, 10; height, 10\u00a0cm). We limited the volume of the chamber headspace (by having a height of<5cm above the ground) to increase the fluxes detection sensitivity. The lid was fitted with a sampling rubber septum and a vent for maintaining pressure equilibrium between the chamber space and atmospheric pressure. The top is equipped with rubber to ensure airtight sealing during sampling headspace. The chambers remained undisturbed during the study period, except during major land management operations such as land preparation, manure application, fertilization, and planting. During such events, the chambers were removed and re-installed immediately after. Chambers at the grazing land were not removed during the entire study period.\n\nThe soil GHG fluxes measurements were conducted weekly during rainy periods and biweekly during dry periods. Additionally, soil GHG fluxes measurements were done following key field management activities such as plowing, manure or fertilizer application, planting, and rainfall. The chamber base and lid were held airtight using the circular rubber band during each sampling event. During sampling, a digital thermometer (TFA thermometer, Zum Ottersberg, Wertheim, Germany) was placed inside the chamber space to monitor temperature changes. Soil GHG samples were collected between 0800 and 1200 hours; the time was considered representative of the diurnal temperature, thus limiting variation in fluxes patterns. During each sampling event, 60\u00a0ml of gas was sampled from each chamber using a 60-ml capacity syringe fitted with a Luer-lock, the first 20\u00a0ml of the gas sample was used to flush 20-ml glass vials, and 40\u00a0ml was injected into 20-ml glass vials to achieve overpressure and minimize chances of contamination due to ambient air diffusion before analysis. The soil GHG samples were collected at 0-, 10-, 20-, and 30-min intervals. The gas samples were transported to Mazingira Laboratories (the International Livestock Research Institute) for analysis.\n\nThe soil CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations were analyzed using SRI 8610C gas chromatography (GC). The GC was equipped with methanizer for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>. The GC was tailored with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and a <sup>63</sup>Ni-electron capture detector (ECD) for N<sub>2</sub>O. We used 20\u00a0ml of nitrogen as a carrier gas during the soil GHG concentration analysis. We calibrated the GC after every four samples using a known concentration of [CO<sub>2</sub> (403, 810, 1,458, and 2,420 ppm), CH<sub>4</sub> (2, 8, 20, and 49 ppm), and N<sub>2</sub>O (329, 761, 1,190, and 2,530 ppb)]. We used the relationship between peak area and concentration over the 30-min headspace to determine the soil GHG fluxes. Since FID assumes a linear function upon chamber closure, the CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were calculated using linear regression. We used nonlinear and power functions between N<sub>2</sub>O mass and time to calculate soil N<sub>2</sub>O concentration, since the ECD assumes a nonlinear power function between time and N<sub>2</sub>O masses. The three chambers represented replicates in each LUTs, given that the experiment was mounted on real smallholder fields, hence not a typical experimental design.\n\n## Soil GHG fluxes calculation\n\nThe soil GHG fluxes were calculated by accounting for environmental factors, including air pressure and temperature, following the ideal gas law following **Equation 1**.\n\n$$\nFghg=\\frac{b\\times Mw\\times Vch\\times 60\\times {10}^6}{Ach\\times Vm\\times {10}^9} \\tag{Equation 1}\n$$\n\nwhere *Fghg* is the flux rate, *b* is the slope of increase/decrease in concentration, *Mw* is the molecular weight of component (g mol<sup>\u22121</sup>), *Vch* is chamber volume (m3), *Ach* is chamber area (m<sup>2</sup>), and *Vm* is the corrected standard gaseous molar volume (m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) given by **Equation 2**.\n\n$$\nVm=22.4\\times {10}^{-3}{m}^{-3}mo{l}^{-1}\\times \\frac{273.15+Temp}{273.15}\\times \\frac{airpressure}{1013} \\tag{Equation 2}\n$$"} 
{"question": "How do soil properties and land utilization types influence greenhouse gas emissions?", "answer": "Soil properties such as bulk density, organic carbon, moisture, and clay content significantly influence greenhouse gas emissions. For example, soil CO2 emissions are positively correlated with soil organic carbon, moisture, and clay content, while N2O fluxes are negatively correlated with bulk density, clay content, and roots. Land utilization types also play a role, with different types showing varying levels of soil bulk density, organic carbon, and moisture, which in turn affect the GHG emissions. Agroforestry M showed the highest soil organic carbon and moisture, leading to higher CO2 emissions, while grazing land had the highest bulk density.", "context": "The quality of gas concentration was checked using R<sup>2</sup> of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. For validation and reliability of the GHG concentration, we discarded the fourth sampling interval data in the event of R<sup>2</sup><0.90 for CO<sub>2</sub>, as fluxes were assumed to have experienced leakage. However, upon discarding the fourth sampling interval and the R<sup>2</sup> was still<90%, we assumed contamination, and that dataset was discarded for analysis. We computed the minimum detection limits for both linear and nonlinear models following Parkin et al. for CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions at \u00b10.03 and \u00b10.08 CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C mg m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>, 2.87 and 9.52 mg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>, and \u00b13.16 and \u00b19.90 \u03bcgN<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>. We observed both negative and positive soil\u2013atmosphere CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O exchange, indicating that the soils acted as both sources and sinks of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. The soil\u2013atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> balances were always positive, indicating that the ground was the net source of CO<sub>2</sub>. We computed cumulative CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions for each LUT replicate using linear interpolation between sampling days based on the trapezoidal rule, following Barton et al.. We also calculated the net global warming potential (GWP) following Mu et al., where every gas unit was converted to CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent by using a factor of 298=N<sub>2</sub>O and 25=CH<sub>4</sub>.\n\n## Soil and weather monitoring\n\nWe collected soil samples at 0\u201320 cm depth for soil organic carbon, bulk density, and soil texture analysis using a 5-cm diameter and 5-cm height core ring (Eijkelkamp Agrisearch Equipment, Giesbeek, The Netherlands). We collected four samples from every LUT totaling 60 samples. We mixed the samples for soil texture analysis to form one composite sample in every LUT, totaling five samples. The soil samples were analyzed following Okalebo et al.. For soil organic carbon determination, we used the Walkley\u2013Black method. We oven-dried the soil samples at 105\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h for soil bulk density determination. The soil bulk density was determined gravimetrically following Okalebo et al.. We determined the soil texture using the hydrometer method. We used the remaining samples to determine soil pH using distilled water. We collected rainfall data using a manual rain gauge installed in the study area. We collected 0\u20135 cm depth samples for soil moisture content determination during the soil GHG sampling events. Soil moisture was determined by oven drying at 105\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, and moisture was determined gravimetrically. We also measured the chamber temperature and soil temperature using a thermometer (TFA thermometer, Zum Ottersberg, Wertheim, Germany).\n\n## Crop yields and yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions\n\nWe sampled 3\u00a0m \u00d7 3\u00a0m plot dimensions across the LUTs except for the grazing land to estimate crop grain yields. Three subplots were selected to estimate crop yields in each land utilization type. We sampled four planting holes (eight plants) to determine crop biomass. We determined the wet weight of the crop harvest using an electronic balance. We air-dried the soil roots, leaves, stems, and grains sub-samples for 3 weeks and oven-dried the subsamples at 60\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. We weighed subsamples after drying and converted the yields to kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>. We reported the grain yields for maize and sorghum at 12.5% moisture content following Ngetich et al.. We divided the soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes **(**gN<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) with the grain yields (kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) to determine the yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions following Musafiri et al..\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nThe GHG data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS 9.4 software. Before analysis, we tested the normality of soil GHG fluxes using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. The soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were not normally distributed; thus, they were log-transformed. We tested the influence of the land utilization types, seasons, and replicates on soil GHG fluxes using a mixed linear model. We used land utilization types as fixed effects and replicates and seasons as random factors. We performed Pearson correlation to test the relationship between soil GHG fluxes and soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, clay content, soil temperature, soil moisture, and roots.\n\n# Results and discussion\n\n## Soil and weather data\n\nSoil bulk density significantly ( *p*<0.0001) differed across land utilization types (**Table\u00a01**). We observed the highest soil bulk density of 1.53\u00a0g cm<sup>\u22121</sup> under grazing land and the lowest at 1.20\u00a0g cm<sup>\u22121</sup> under agroforestry L. The soil organic carbon varied significantly ( *p*<0.0001) among the land utilization types (**Table\u00a01**). We found the highest soil organic carbon, 2.23%, under agroforestry M and the lowest, 0.60%, under sole maize. The soil texture was loam across different land utilization types (**Table\u00a02**).\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a02: Baseline soil properties under different land utilization types at 0\u201320 cm depth in Siaya County, Kenya.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n LUTs1 & Bulk density (g cm\u2212<sup>3</sup>) & Nmin & SOC(\\%) & Soil pH & \\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Soil texture(\\%)} \\\\\n \\hline\n & & & & & Sand & Clay & Silt \\\\\n \\midrule\n Agroforestry M & 1.23<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 6.0 & 2.23<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.08 & 5.2 & 47 & 19 & 34 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole sorghum & 1.40<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 4.3 & 1.50<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.03 & 4.9 & 48 & 15 & 37 \\\\\n \\hline\n Agroforestry L & 1.20<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 7.5 & 2.07<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 5.4 & 46 & 18 & 36 \\\\\n \\hline\n Sole maize & 1.50<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 4.2 & 0.61<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.05 & 4.8 & 52 & 18 & 30 \\\\\n \\hline\n Grazing land & 1.53<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 6.1 & 2.01<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.04 & 5.1 & 50 & 18 & 32 \\\\\n \\hline\n *P* value & <0.0001 & & <0.0001 & & \u2013 & \u2013 & \u2013 \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T2}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nSoil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were positively correlated to soil organic carbon ( *p*=0.0001), soil moisture ( *p*=0.04), and clay content ( *p*=0.03) (**Table\u00a03**).

The cumulative seasonal rainfall was 728 and 737\u00a0mm during the SR20 and LR21 (**Figure\u00a02A**). The overall rainfall amount was consistent with the long-term average rainfall amount in the study area, ranging between 800 and 1,900 mm.\n\n## Soil GHG fluxes\n\nWe observed both negative and positive soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across land utilization types throughout the study periods.

We observed low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on July 20 and January 21 across the LUTs. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were lower under sole maize and sorghum than in grazing land. We also observed high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions following precipitation events throughout the study periods. Compared to all the LUTs, agroforestry M had the highest peaks following precipitation events."} 
{"question": "What factors contribute to the variation in soil N2O emissions across different land utilization types in East Africa?", "answer": "The variation in soil N2O emissions across different land utilization types in East Africa is influenced by several factors, including the application of animal manure, which increases the availability of labile carbon, leading to higher N2O emissions. High rainfall events increase soil moisture, reducing oxygen availability and promoting denitrification. The presence of dung and urine in grazing lands also contributes to increased N2O emissions upon soil rewetting. Additionally, farm management practices such as fertilization and plowing, which coincide with precipitation, create conditions favorable for nitrification and denitrification processes, further influencing N2O emissions.", "context": "The soil N<sub>2</sub>O results from this study are consistent with other studies conducted in the range of previous studies in East Africa that found a range of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from \u221220.00 to 200 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> in maize crop under similar conditions. Grazing land also resulted in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions of up to 150 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>, which was similar to the findings of Ortiz-Gonzalo et al., who found a range of emissions from 20 to 500 \u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> in the pasture land due to application of dung (mixture of dung and urine). The daily N<sub>2</sub>O reached peaks during high rainfall events that could be explained by the difference in soil moisture that led to the reduction in oxygen, hence denitrification. The onset of rains that coincided with planting and fertilization offered ideal conditions for nitrification and denitrification processes due to reduced oxygen availability limiting microbial activity. The four LUTs were applied with animal manure (**Table\u00a01**), which is the controlling factor in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by increasing the availability of labile carbon. Hickman et al. found an increase in N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes by 58% from the fertilized chambers upon application of manure compared to unfertilized plots under *Zea mays* in western Kenya. The availability of water in soil micropores coupled with the availability of carbon from manure increases the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions unless saturation is reached. Even though we had no data on different levels of soil saturation, Wanyama et\u00a0al. reported that the production of N<sub>2</sub>O is produced until soil saturation is reached, where N<sub>2</sub>O is consumed due to the limitation of oxygen in the soil. In addition, the availability of dung and urine deposition under grazing land could have increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions upon soil rewetting. Mineralization in the soil leads to the production of N<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, the peaks under grazing land could be explained by dung presence on grasses. Generally, the key events that elaborate N<sub>2</sub>O peak are high precipitation, increasing soil moisture content, and fertilizer application. Macharia et al. and Musafiri et al. found that N<sub>2</sub>O impulse is due to major events, as listed earlier. Under grazing land, the peaks can be explained by animal dung and urine deposition.\n\nSoils acted as CH<sub>4</sub> sinks and sources during the study period. These results were similar to the findings conducted in East Africa that found a range of 0.02 to \u221260 CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> in smallholder croplands under similar condition. There was low CH<sub>4</sub> production during the dry period due to the high rate of gas diffusivity and favorable aerobic conditions for CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. However, during the onset of rainfall, which led to an increase in moisture content, the CH<sub>4</sub> uptake became low, reflecting the effects of moisture on CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes.\n\nWe observed an increase in soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission at the onset of the rainfall across the LUTs. These observations are similar to the findings from SSA that found a range of 30\u2013400 mgCO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> under different land use types under similar conditions. In addition, Pelster et al. and Musafiri et\u00a0al. reported similar findings to our results following major events such plowing, planting, and fertilization on smallholder farms. Generally, farm management practices and soil humidity perturbation affect both soils biotic and abiotic factors. An influence on soil microclimate affects bio-faunal activities that drive carbon in the soil, thus soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Therefore, farm activities such as fertilization, which coincided with precipitation across different LUT explain the high pulse of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. For the case of grazing, we observed high pulse CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the first rainfall events, which can be elaborated by the rewetting of animal droppings, thus causing the Birch effect. However, there were instances of low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to low moisture content, which is the function of precipitation (**Table\u00a03**). In addition, there were periods with no plants in the field except grazing land during the study period. Therefore, it is imperative to note the contribution of plants in respiratory processes, such as root respiration, that is likely to increase soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\n## Cumulative GHG fluxes\n\nThe cumulative seasonal soil GHG emissions (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O) significantly varied across the land utilization types (**Table\u00a04**). We observed the highest CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes under sole maize (38% more compared to all LUTs during SR 20 and LR 21. We observed the lowest CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes under agroforestry L and sole sorghum M during SR 20. During LR 21, there was 40% more CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under agroforestry L. We observed 30% and 36% more N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under agroforestry L than all the LUTs during SR 20 and LR 21, respectively. However, we observed 13% less N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under agroforestry M than all the LUTs during SR 21. Grazing land emitted high CO<sub>2</sub> (29% and 25% during SR 20 and LR 21, respectively) compared to other LUTs. We observed significant seasonal differences ( *p*<0.0001) and seasonal interactions ( *p*<0.0001) during the study.\n\n```latex-table\n\\begin{table}\n \\caption{Table\u00a04: Soil GHG emissions (mean \u00b1 SEM) as influenced by land utilization types between July 2020 and May 2021 in Siaya County, Kenya.}\n \\begin{center}\n \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\n \\toprule\n Season1 & LUTs2 & CH<sub>4</sub> (kg CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & CO<sub>2</sub> (kg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & N<sub>2</sub>O (kg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013Nha<sup>\u22121</sup>) & Net GWP kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq ha<sup>\u22121</sup> year<sup>\u22121</sup> \\\\\n \\midrule\n SR 2020 & Agroforestry M & \u22120.43<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 6,347.52<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 168.25 & 0.26<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 67.92 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole sorghum & \u22120.42<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 6,208.58<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 344.15 & 0.40<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 108.89 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Agroforestry L & \u22120.23<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.05 & 5,108.25<sup>cd</sup> \u00b1 551.70 & 0.58<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 166.03 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole maize & \u22120.87<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.03 & 3,967.88<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 620.55 & 0.43<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 0.03 & 106.02 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Grazing land & \u22120.34<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.09 & 8,949.50<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 515.86 & 0.29<sup>bc</sup>0.05 & 77.28 \\\\\n \\hline\n & p-value & 0.001 & 0.0001 & 0.002 & \\\\\n \\hline\n LR 2021 & Agroforestry M & \u22120.20<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 5,367.04<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 129.41 & 1.28<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 377.18 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole sorghum & \u22120.004<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 4,110.33<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 209.15 & 0.69<sup>cd</sup> \u00b1 0.05 & 205.01 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Agroforestry L & \u22120.26<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 4,423.09<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 419.20 & 1.90<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.11 & 558.87 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole maize & \u22120.18<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 2,541.98<sup>d</sup>252.01 & 1.00<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 303.35 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Grazing land & \u22120.005<sup>b</sup>0.01 & 5,451.25<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 382.33 & 0.40<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 120.55 \\\\\n \\hline\n & p-value & <0.0001 & 0.0001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\hline\n Cumulative & Agroforestry M & \u22120.63<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 0.01 & 11,714.56<sup>ab</sup> \u00b1 110.76 & 1.54<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 444.86 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole sorghum & \u22120.42<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.06 & 10,318.91<sup>bc</sup> \u00b1 931.05 & 1.09<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.02 & 289.69 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Agroforestry L & \u22120.49<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.04 & 9,531.34<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 948.53 & 2.48<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.11 & 736.53 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Sole maize & \u22121.05<sup>e</sup> \u00b1 0.26 & 6,509.86<sup>d</sup> \u00b1 561.37 & 1.43<sup>b</sup> \u00b1 0.5 & 531.13 \\\\\n \\hline\n & Grazing land & \u22120.35<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 0.09 & 14,400.75<sup>a</sup> \u00b1 1,210.88 & 0.69<sup>c</sup> \u00b1 0.07 & 223.37 \\\\\n \\hline\n & p-value & <0.0001 & 0.001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\hline\n & Seasonal *p* vaue<sup>4</sup> & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\hline\n & Season*LUT<sup>5</sup> & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & <0.0001 & \\\\\n \\bottomrule\n \\end{tabular}\n \\end{center}\n \\label{T4}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nAnnual cumulative soil GHG emissions varied across the land utilization types (**Table\u00a04**). The CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under sole maize was 75% more than on grazing land. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 69% higher in grazing land than in sole maize. Conversely, grazing land emitted 22% less N<sub>2</sub>O than agroforestry L. The global warming potential was positive across the LUTs and seasons. Compared to sole maize, grazing had 10 times net contribution of GWP. Agroforestry L had a high net GWP compared to Agroforestry M across the seasons."} 
{"question": "How do management practices affect methane (CH4) uptake in different land utilization types (LUTs)?", "answer": "Management practices such as manure application and tillage impact soil organic carbon, which serves as substrates for methanogenic archaea, influencing CH4 uptake. Practices that reduce soil bulk density, like agroforestry, enhance gas diffusivity and increase CH4 uptake. Conversely, conditions like flooding can create anaerobic environments conducive to CH4 production, reducing uptake.", "context": "The soil acted as a net sink of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes. The cumulative soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake ranged from \u22120.21 to \u22120.68 kg CH<sub>4</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup> consistent with previous studies in East Africa under similar conditions on smallholder farms. The difference in soil CH<sub>4</sub> due to management practices across the LUTs explains the difference in CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. Management practices such as manure application and tillage greatly impact the soil organic carbon that acts as substrates for methanogenic archaea. Sole maize had high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake due to low SOC (**Table\u00a02**). Soil bulk density is among the factors that control CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes. Generally, soil bulk density is a function of soil porosity, thus predicting diffusivity rate. Agroforestry M had a high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. This could be explained by low soil bulk density (**Table\u00a02**), which increases the gas diffusivity rate. The high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake in the agroforestry M could be attributed to the high diffusivity rate due to low soil bulk density coupled with high porosity. On the contrary, during SR 2020, there was low CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under agroforestry M due to flooding that could have created anaerobic conditions suitable for CH<sub>4</sub> production.\n\nThe low soil bulk density could account for soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under agroforestry L. In addition, even though we did not measure mineral N, *leucacena leucocephala* could have fixed nitrogen in the soil. Thus, increasing NH4+\u2013N competes for the mono-oxygenase enzyme, accelerating CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. According to a review by Kim et al., the agroforestry systems increase N in the soil. In addition, the application of manure (**Table\u00a01**) coupled with varied management practices leads to an N gradient across the LUTs, hence different CH<sub>4</sub> uptake levels. We observed low CH<sub>4</sub> uptake cumulatively and during SR 2020 season. This could be due to high soil organic carbon that functions as substrates for methanogenesis processes. In addition, animal trampling causes soil structure disturbances, thus high soil bulk density, leading to the establishment of methanogenic archaea.\n\nWe also observed seasonal treatment interactions, which could be attributed to the differences in crop performance and precipitation during the two cropping seasons. The low CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes during the LR 21 could be due to increased CH<sub>4</sub> production. The applied manure not used by crops necessitated CH<sub>4</sub> production. The applied organic amendments in the different land utilization types could increase anaerobic microsites, resulting in CH<sub>4</sub> production.\n\nThe cumulative annual soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ranged from 6,509.86 to 14,400.75 kg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup>, which was slightly higher compared to the previous studies in Kenya that found a range of 1,391\u20136,000 kg CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013C ha<sup>\u22121</sup> emissions under similar conditions. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were seasonal, and they followed major events such as precipitation, plowing, and fertilization similar to observations by Pelster et al.. We observed a significant difference in CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes across LUTs and seasons, with grazing having high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across the season. The highest soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in grazing land could be attributed to high soil organic carbon available due to continuous root availability from *Solanum incanum* that could have favored nutrient pumping and consequently increased emissions. Additionally, the high amount of carbon concentration under grazing land (**Table\u00a02**) could have provided the substrate and energy for microorganisms, thus high decomposition rates. Rosenstock et al. and Wachiye et al. found an increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emission with increasing carbon in soil compartments. This can explain the high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under grazing land. The continuous availability of animal droppings for the entire study period explains the high amounts of carbon compared to other LUTs. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be elaborated by the positive correlation of SOC with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (**Table\u00a03**). Therefore, with an increase in carbon, there is a likelihood of an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\nWe also observed high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under agroforestry systems (agroforestry L and agroforestry M) across the seasons than the monocrops (sole maize and sorghum) LUTs, which can be elaborated by the availability of roots that increases carbon in the soil compartment (**Table\u00a02**) through root degradation. Additionally, the decomposition of leaf litter fall could increase the amounts of carbon, thus high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. On the contrary, the monocrops had low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to low carbon in soil compartments (**Table\u00a02**). Generally, nutrient mining due to harvesting with limited nutrient replenishment could have resulted in low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In addition, high soil bulk density (**Table\u00a02**) results in low soil atmosphere exchange due to low gas diffusivity hence low CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes.\n\nThe variability of CO<sub>2</sub> across the land utilization types can be attributed to the difference in vegetation; this immensely affects the rate of emissions at plants\u2019 roots. The photosynthesis rate differs, affecting respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. The effect of textural characteristics in the LUTs could have majorly contributed to varied CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Additionally, seasonal interactions reflect the effect of moisture on CO<sub>2</sub>. However, we only reported the soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (decomposition and root respiration). Therefore, the entire CO<sub>2</sub> budget from the soil and photosynthesis is essential.\n\nThe cumulative annual soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across the land utilization types were consistent with previous studies in East Africa that found a range of 0.07\u20134.3 kg N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N ha<sup>\u22121</sup> under similar conditions. The difference between soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across LUTs could be due to changes in soil moisture. Although the amount of N was not determined, *L. leucocephala* under agroforestry L that fixes N into soils could have led to high N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. Cubillos-Hinojosa et al. found that *L. leucocephala* has a high C:N ratio because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen to the soils. These phenomena could explain the difference in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under the two agroforestry systems (agroforestry M and agroforestry L). We also observed lower N<sub>2</sub>O emissions cumulatively under agroforestry M than agroforestry L due to the difference in species. Generally, the amount of soil N in the agroforestry systems is species dependent, which could explain the difference in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions among the two LUTs. Furthermore, soil organic carbon acts as substrates for the soil microbes, consequently influencing denitrification and nitrification. The high amounts of soil organic carbon under the agroforestry systems (**Table\u00a02**) could have led to high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. In addition, the amount of leaf litterfall could have necessitated anaerobic conditions under the agroforestry systems, thus high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Zheng et al. reported high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under croplands applied with stovers.\n\nThere was low production of N<sub>2</sub>O under grazing cumulatively than other LUTs. We expected high N<sub>2</sub>O emissions due to the availability of animal droppings throughout the study period. Zhu et\u00a0al. reported that nitrous emissions correlate linearly with the amount of dung deposited on grasses. In addition, Pelster et al. reported high N<sub>2</sub>O in grassland. We found a negative correlation between BD and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Similar to this finding, Wanyama et al. found a negative correlation between N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and soil bulk density. Thus, high bulk density under grazing land explains low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, although in the denitrification process, it is expected that bulk soils favor denitrification due to the consumption of O<sub>2</sub>, thus avoiding diffusion. Other factors, such as soil texture and temperature, could have played a major role in the nitrification and denitrification processes. Sole maize and sole sorghum showed low denitrification across the season (**Table\u00a04**) compared to other LUTs. This could be explained by the low amount of carbon (which explains the low availability of labile carbon) that is necessary for denitrification processes by acting as electron donors for microbial activities. However, our study contradicted the findings of Wanyama et al., which found that high soil organic carbon correlates linearly with N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. We found a negative correlation between soil organic carbon with N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Low soil pH under sole maize and sole sorghum could have limited denitrification processes.\n\nGenerally, soil pH influences soil microbial activities. Low soil pH favors N<sub>2</sub>O uptake. Rosenstock et al. found an increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions with increasing soil pH. We can also attribute low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under sole maize and sole sorghum to clay content. The low amount of clay content necessitated the nitrification process at the expense of denitrification."} 
{"question": "How does crop residue retention affect N2O emissions in flood-prone soils, and what are the implications for smallholder farming practices in Kenya?", "answer": "Crop residue retention can increase N2O emissions in flood-prone soils due to the induction of labile carbon, which enhances the denitrification process by providing electron donors to soil microbes. However, in Kenyan smallholder farming, crop residue retention is limited due to competition with livestock for fodder and the need for fuel, leading to lower N2O emissions under sole sorghum cultivation. This suggests a trade-off between improving soil fertility and managing greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need for balanced land management practices.", "context": "Crop residue retention is essential in improving fertility and yields. The novelty of crop residue retention on the field due to its ability to incorporate nutrients could have mixed effects on the soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. Crop residue retention increases the induction of labile carbon that plays a fundamental role during the denitrification process by acting as electron donors to soil microbes. The study was conducted on flood-prone soils that provided favorable conditions for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. The crop residue retention could increase N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. However, crop residue retention is limited in most Kenyan smallholder cropping practices due to livestock competition and fuel, which partly explains low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under sole sorghum.\n\n## Maize and sorghum production\n\nThe grain yield ranged from 5,221.5 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (sole maize, n=3) to 505.3\u00a0kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> (sole sorghum, n=3) (**Table\u00a05**). We observed low roots, leaves, and stem production during the season (**Table\u00a05**).

However, the sorghum yields were lower than the potential sorghum productivity of 4,000 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>. The maize grain yields of 5,222 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> were consistent with those reported by previous studies in Western Kenya, ranging between 500 and 5,600 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup>. The low sorghum productivity in the study area could be attributed to poor rain timing and agronomic management coupled with *S. hermonthica* infestation. The *S. hermonthica* is a significant threat to sorghum production in Western Kenya, resulting in reduced grain productivity. The calculated N<sub>2</sub>O yield scaled emissions ranged between 0.35 and 4.90\u00a0g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup> and was consistent with 0.024\u201367 g N<sub>2</sub>O\u2013N kg<sup>\u22121</sup>. The low yield-scaled emission could be attributed to the low soil GHG emissions across the land utilization types. It is noteworthy that sole sorghum had higher yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions than sole maize. This could be attributed to the low sorghum productivity due to poor management and *S. hermonthica* infestation, lowering the yields. Notably, the improved land utilization management, such as agroforestry L and agroforestry M, led to increased yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, the yield scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were based on cereal crop grain yields.\n\nDespite the importance of agroforestry systems (agroforestry L and agroforestry M) in terms of carbon input and YSE, their potential to contribute to global warming is high. The agroforestry systems exhibited high net GWP compared to monocrops (sole sorghum and sole maize). Therefore, in terms of YSE, there is a tradeoff between food production and GHG. It is imperative to note the importance of agroforestry systems in food production and the ability to input carbon, a function of N in soil compartments. The viability of integrating plants and crops is under disputation. It can increase yields and GHG emissions, and it can also increase yields. In addition, the monocrops have varied implications on edaphic factors and consequently climate change. Despite low GWP, sole sorghum and sole maize contributed to the deterioration of soil health. Therefore, the balance between crop productivity in smallholder farms can be achieved through agroforestry systems because it improves soil health. We advocate for agroforestry systems due to their ability to improve soil health, climate regulation, and food production.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThere is a vast data gap on the quantity of soil GHG fluxes across different land utilization types in Kenya. We quantified the soil GHG fluxes from five common land utilization types. In line with our hypothesis, grazing land had the highest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while sole maize had the lowest. We also hypothesized that agroforestry L could increase crop yields and reduce yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. There was high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake under monocrops. The soil GHG fluxes were CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were of low magnitude although consistent with other studies in Kenya. The most critical drivers influencing GHG in this experiment were soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. Improved land utilization types (agroforestry M and agroforestry L) did not increase grain yields but increased yield-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Due to the soil\u2019s high moisture levels occasioned by frequent waterlogging under agroforestry systems, the yields were low, while the YSE was high. The high YSE can be reduced by enhancing the yields through improving fertilization and managing *Striga* weeds infestations. However, the study did not consider the importance of the agroforestry trees to smallholder farmers, such as fodder crops for feeding livestock ( *L. leucocephala*) and timber from *M. lutea.* Following our findings, there is a need for further studies to consider the benefits of agroforestry integration on the income among smallholder farmers. This shades more light on the tradeoffs expressed as income-scaled N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes of agroforestry land utilization compared to monocropping. Our findings are essential, as they established the contribution of different land utilization types, thus filling the data gap on the National GHG budget."}

    "Cropland Net Ecosystem Exchange Estimation for the Inland Pampas (Argentina) Using EVI, Land Cover Maps, and Eddy Covariance Fluxes\n==============\n\nUlises Marconato ,Roberto J. Fernández ,Gabriela Posse\n\n# Abstract\n\nEstimations of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) are crucial to assess the carbon sequestration\/carbon source capacity of agricultural systems. Although several global models have been built to describe carbon flux patterns based on flux tower data, South American ecosystems (and croplands in particular) are underrepresented in the databases used to calibrate these models, leading to large uncertainties in regional and global NEE estimation. Despite the fact that almost half of the land surface is used worldwide for agricultural activities, these models still do not include variables related to cropland management. Using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MODIS imagery (250 m) and monthly CO<sub>2<\/sub> exchange from a 9-year record of an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower in a crop field in the Inland Pampas region, we developed regression models to predict monthly NEE. We tested whether including a term for crop identity\/land cover as a categorical variable (maize, soybean, wheat, and fallow) could improve model capability in capturing monthly NEE dynamics. NEE measured at the flux tower site was scaled to croplands across the Inland Pampa using crop-type maps, from which annual NEE maps were generated for the 2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021 agricultural campaigns. The model based solely on EVI showed to be a good predictor of monthly NEE for the study region ( *r*<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.78), but model adjustment was improved by including a term for crop identity ( *r*<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.83). A second set of maps was generated taking into account carbon exports during harvest to estimate Net Biome Productivity (NBP) at the county level. Crops across the region as a whole acted as a carbon sink during the three studied campaigns, although with highly heterogeneous spatial and temporal patterns. Between 60% and 80% of the carbon sequestered was exported during harvest, a large decrease from the carbon sequestration capacity estimated using just NEE, which further decreased if fossil carbon emissions from agricultural supplies are taken into account. Estimates presented in this study are a first step towards upscaling carbon fluxes at the regional scale in a South American cropland area, and could help to improve regional to global estimations of carbon fluxes and refine national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories.\n\n# Introduction\n\nEstimations of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) are crucial to assess the carbon sequestration or source capacity of agricultural systems. NEE of terrestrial ecosystems is quantified by the difference between CO<sub>2<\/sub> uptake *via* gross photosynthetic assimilation (GPP) and release of CO<sub>2<\/sub><sub>via<\/sub>ecosystem-wide respiration processes (R<sub>eco<\/sub>). GPP and net primary production (NPP) often used by ecologists do not fully describe the feedback of the ecosystems–atmosphere carbon exchange as NEE does, because they do not explicitly include soil-derived fluxes and other fluxes associated with heterotrophic respiration. In managed agricultural ecosystems, estimates of carbon balance have to be complemented NEE with “lateral” fluxes such as crop harvest, deriving what is known as Net Biome Productivity (NBP), also called Net Ecosystem Carbon Budget (NECB). To identify whether a managed ecosystem is a net source or a destination of carbon, it is necessary to calculate its NBP, since many times NEE suggests that the ecosystem is sequestering carbon when in fact it is acting as a net source.\n\nDuring the last three decades, measurements of NEE between ecosystems and the atmosphere *via* direct quantification of net carbon flux have been carried out using the eddy covariance technique (EC; ). Currently, there are at least 212 unevenly distributed sites around the world with EC micrometeorological towers included in the FLUXNET global network, and its FLUXNET2015 database, providing measurements of exchange of CO<sub>2<\/sub>, water vapor, and energy, plus associated biological and meteorological variables. Although the effective area of the EC measurements, its “footprint”, is relatively small, often less than 1 km<sup>2<\/sup>, the variability of NEE at these sites is representative of variability at larger spatial scales. The combined use of the FLUXNET2015 database, spatially explicit climate information, and satellite products such as vegetation indices has enabled the extrapolation of carbon fluxes from the local scale to the regional, continental, and global scales.\n\nAlthough several global models have been built to describe carbon flux patterns based on EC data and vegetation indices, South American ecosystems (and croplands in particular) are still underrepresented in the databases used to calibrate these models, leading to large uncertainties in the regional and global estimatesof NEE. Global models show less than 50% efficiency in their ability to predict NEE. This may be attributable, at least in part, to approximately 85% of the FLUXNET sites used to calibrate these models being located in the northern hemisphere, mainly between 30°C and 55°C of latitude. Croplands cover about 12%–13% of the Earth’s ice-free land surface, and even when ca. 10% of FLUXNET sites are croplands, none of them is located in the southern hemisphere.\n\nHuman interventions are one of the key non-climatic controls of the carbon balance. Despite the fact that almost half of the land surface is already used worldwide for agricultural activities (livestock and crop production ), the inclusion of management-related variables in models remains a challenge, specially for croplands.",
    "Nitrogen Gain and Loss Along an Ecosystem Sequence: From Semi-desert to Rainforest\n==============\n\nKhaled Abdallah ,Svenja C. Stock ,Felix Heeger ,Moritz Koester ,Francisco Nájera ,Francisco Matus ,Carolina Merino ,Sandra Spielvogel ,Anna A. Gorbushina ,Yakov Kuzyakov\n\n# Abstract\n\nPlants and microorganisms, besides the climate, drive nitrogen (N) cycling in ecosystems. Our objective was to investigate N losses and N acquisition strategies along a unique ecosystem-sequence (ecosequence) ranging from arid shrubland through Mediterranean woodland to temperate rainforest. These ecosystems differ in mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperate, and vegetation cover, but developed on similar granitoid soil parent material, were addressed using a combination of molecular biology and soil biogeochemical tools. Soil N and carbon (C) contents, δ<sup>15<\/sup>N signatures, activities of N acquiring extracellular enzymes as well as the abundance of soil bacteria and fungi, and diazotrophs in bulk topsoil and rhizosphere were determined. Relative fungal abundance in the rhizosphere was higher under woodland and forest than under shrubland. This indicates toward plants' higher C investment into fungi in the Mediterranean and temperate rainforest sites than in the arid site. Fungi are likely to decompose lignified forest litter for efficient recycling of litter-derived N and further nutrients. Rhizosphere—a hotspot for the N fixation—was enriched in diazotrophs (factor 8 to 16 in comparison to bulk topsoil) emphasizing the general importance of root\/microbe association in N cycle. These results show that the temperate rainforest is an N acquiring ecosystem, whereas N in the arid shrubland is strongly recycled. Simultaneously, the strongest <sup>15<\/sup>N enrichment with decreasing N content with depth was detected in the Mediterranean woodland, indicating that N mineralization and loss is highest (and likely the fastest) in the woodland across the continental transect. Higher relative aminopeptidase activities in the woodland than in the forest enabled a fast N mineralization. Relative aminopeptidase activities were highest in the arid shrubland. The highest absolute chitinase activities were observed in the forest. This likely demonstrates that (a) plants and microorganisms in the arid shrubland invest largely into mobilization and reutilization of organically bound N by exoenzymes, and (b) that the ecosystem N nutrition shifts from a peptide-based N in the arid shrubland to a peptide- and chitin-based N nutrition in the temperate rainforest, where the high N demand is complemented by intensive N fixation in the rhizosphere.\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn terrestrial ecosystems, precipitation affects nitrogen (N) cycling through its effect on leaching, soil erosion, and microbial activity. Increased precipitation can result in significant leaching and run-off events, decreasing N retention and increasing N losses. Since more than 90% of soil N is bound in soil organic matter (SOM), the availability of N in most terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by microbial mineralization, which is strongly dependent on soil moisture and temperature. Optimal soil moisture and temperature conditions for N transformation in arid ecosystems, for example, are only present after rainfall pulses. Under these conditions, soil microorganisms can mineralize N, but low plant activity and, consequently, low N absorption by roots can result in the accumulation of easily available N in soils that is potentially prone to be leached in case of strong rainfall events. With increasing precipitation and soil moisture, microbial activity increases, accelerating N mineralization, on the one hand, but increasing N immobilization within the growing microbial biomass, on the other hand, both affecting the N distribution along soil profiles—from microbial-active topsoils toward subsoils with low microbial abundances and activities.\n\nThe balance of N inputs and outputs of an ecosystem can be assessed by vertical soil δ<sup>15<\/sup>N signatures. The relationship of soil δ<sup>15<\/sup>N and N content [mathematically expressed as -ln(%N)] with depth represents an integration of the soil <sup>15<\/sup>N enrichment with increasing soil age. Thereby, an intensive N transformation of soil organic matter is indicated by a strong <sup>15<\/sup>N enrichment of the remaining soil N.\n\nSimultaneous increase in plant productivity and plant N uptake under higher water availability intensify the competition for N between plants and microorganisms. Thus, depending on the climatic conditions, plants have to adapt their N acquisition strategies. Under dry conditions, leaching losses are generally low and soil N can be recycled by means of extracellular enzymes. However, soil N losses by leaching under high precipitation calls for mechanisms to replenish depleted N pools and optimization of recycling processes to decrease leaching losses.\n\nBiological N fixation, by symbiotic diazotrophic microorganisms and free-living microorganisms that can fix N independent of root presence, is the major natural source of N in most terrestrial ecosystems. Free-living and symbiotic diazotrophs possess the *nifH* gene (Hirsch and Mauchline, 2015), a key structural gene encoding the reductase subunit of the nitrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes N<sub>2<\/sub> reduction to biological available forms. The *nifH* gene has commonly been used as a genetic marker in studies of diazotroph diversity and abundance and could be a potential indirect approach to the assessment of levels of biological N fixation in soils. Biological N fixation provides diazotrophs with an ecological advantage in N limited environments. However, the growth efficiency of diazotrophs is negatively affected due to the high energy costs of N<sub>2<\/sub> fixation and the costs for providing an oxygen-free environment as a prerequisite for the nitrogenase activity. Thus, C vs. N demand define the abundance of diazotrophs in ecosystems.\n\nStudies along continental transects of ecosystems (i.e., ecosequence) distinct in mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperate, vegetation cover, and composition, but with common soil parent material, can be valuable study objects to evaluate acquisition strategies depending on climate conditions.",
    "The study areas are located outside the northern limit of the Last Glacial Maximum. Rivers and catchments that drained areas with Alpine glaciers at the latitudes of the study areas were excluded from the site selection(www.earthshape.net)). The selected catchments are located in national parks or nature preserves and cover the typical vegetation for the respective climate zone with low anthropogenic influence. More details regarding the geological conditions, denudation rates, soils, and vegetation of the study areas can be found in the studies by Bernhard et al., Canessa et al., Oeser et al., and Schaller et al..\n\n## Soil Sampling\n\nThree soil sample sets were analyzed in this study. Two sample sets were collected in the later austral summer 2016 (i.e., in March) from the sites Santa Gracia, La Campana and Nahuelbuta. The third sample set was collected in the austral spring 2016 (i.e., November) at the sites Quebrada de Talca, La Campana, and Nahuelbuta. Both arid shrubland sites lie in similar distance to the Pacific Ocean and similar soil and vegetation compositions can be found. The vegetation cover in Quebrada de Talca, however, is denser than in Santa Gracia due to the exclusion of grazing.\n\nThe first sample set ( *rhizosphere set*) served to determine the belowground C input via rhizodeposits and the importance of N fixation by root associated diazotrophs. At each site, samples were taking from four soil pits: one soil pit on a north-facing slope at mid-slope position and three on a south-facing slope, arranged as a catena (top-, mid-, and toe-slope) (i.e., four field replicates). From each pit, the rhizosphere soil (0–6 mm distance from root) was collected in 3 depth increments. Therefore, the soil profile from the surface to the saprolite was defined as 100%, and samples were collected from 0–50% and 50–100% solum depth, and >100% which comprised the saprolite. For absolute depths, please refer to Koester et al.. The results of the rhizosphere samples are presented as means of all soil profiles as slope exposure did not have a notable effect.\n\nWith the second sample set ( *bulk soil set*) the long-term N cycling was evaluated, i.e., whether the N cycling within an ecosystem is open or closed. Bulk samples were collected with a soil auger to a maximal depth of 60 cm (arid shrubland), 120 cm (Mediterranean woodland), and 200 cm (temperate rainforest) from two slopes at mid-slope position (i.e., 8 field replicates).",
    "The normalization of the activities to SOC (a relative proxy for the total available substrate) served to reduce the factor of available substrate amount when comparing enzyme activities between study sites. Briefly, activities were determined using synthetic fluorogenic substrates at the extinction of 355 nm and emission of 460 nm. The maximal rate of activity (V<sub>max<\/sub>; nmol substrate g<sup>−1<\/sup> soil h<sup>−1<\/sup>) was determined by fitting the activities with the Michaelis-Menten Equation. Aminopeptidase activity was calculated as the sum of individually determined tyrosine-aminopeptidase and leucine-aminopeptidase activities.\n\n## Soil DNA Extraction\n\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from 0.5 g of soil (first and third sample set) using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA), following the manufacturer's protocol with modifications including an initial three homogenization cycles with 2 min ice incubations in between. Final DNA extracts were eluted in 80 μL sterile ultrapure water. DNA concentration and quality were measured with a NanoDrop 2000C (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA extracts were stored at −20°C for further analyses.\n\n## Quantification of Microbial Abundance and *nifH* Gene by qPCR\n\nThe abundance of bacterial and fungal DNA as well as diazotrophs was determined by qPCR. The primers used for the qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Bacterial abundance of 16S rRNA gene was quantified using the primer pair Bac27F and Bac338R targeted on 16S rRNA marker. Fungal abundance was quantified using the primer pair NL1F and LS2r targeted on 28S rDNA.",
    "One thousand soils for molecular understanding of belowground carbon cycling\n==============\n\nMaggie M. Bowman ,Alexis E. Heath ,Tamas Varga ,Anil K. Battu ,Rosalie K. Chu ,Jason Toyoda ,Tanya E. Cheeke ,Stephanie S. Porter ,Kevan B. Moffett ,Brittany LeTendre\n\n# Abstract\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in understanding global carbon (C) cycling, the mechanisms regulating belowground C fluxes and storage are still uncertain. New molecular technologies have the power to elucidate these processes, yet we have no widespread standardized implementation of molecular techniques. To address this gap, we introduce the Molecular Observation Network (MONet), a decadal vision from the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), to develop a national network for understanding the molecular composition, physical structure, and hydraulic and biological properties of soil and water. These data are essential for advancing the next generation of multiscale Earth systems models. In this paper, we discuss the 1000 Soils Pilot for MONet, including a description of standardized sampling materials and protocols and a use case to highlight the utility of molecular-level and microstructural measurements for assessing the impacts of wildfire on soil. While the 1000 Soils Pilot generated a plethora of data, we focus on assessments of soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry *via* Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry and microstructural properties *via* X-ray computed tomography to highlight the effects of recent fire history in forested ecosystems on belowground C cycling. We observed decreases in soil respiration, microbial biomass, and potential enzyme activity in soils with high frequency burns. Additionally, the nominal oxidation state of carbon in SOM increased with burn frequency in surface soils. This results in a quantifiable shift in the molecular signature of SOM and shows that wildfire may result in oxidation of SOM and structural changes to soil pore networks that persist into deeper soils.\n\n# Introduction\n\nSoil organic matter (SOM) is a critical part of the global carbon (C) cycle. Belowground ecosystems contain more C than stored in terrestrial vegetation and the atmosphere combined, and SOM is the largest and most biologically active portion of soil C. SOM decomposition is regulated by a complex and interacting set of factors including soil structure, moisture distribution, temperature, pH, and nutrient status; collectively, these factors determine accessibility, bioavailability, and rate kinetics of SOM. Despite the importance of SOM in the global C cycle, the drivers of SOM decomposition from molecular to continental scales are not well understood.\n\nRecent research suggests that standardized, spatially-resolved, and high-resolution data may be critical to reducing the uncertainty surrounding estimates of belowground C dynamics under future climate scenarios. For example, pore-scale structural characterization could reveal spatial factors that inhibit SOM decomposition, and molecular chemistry may provide insight into SOM reactivity that cannot be observed from bulk measurements. As of yet, such information is lacking from soil databases (e.g., Web Soil Survey, International Soil Radiocarbon Database, and Soils Data Harmonization), and no widespread implementations of standardized high-resolution techniques are used to simultaneously investigate the myriad factors influencing SOM decomposition.\n\nConsequently, soil C cycles are poorly represented in biogeochemical and Earth System Models (ESMs) that predict changes in the global climate. For example, most ESMs simulate changes in belowground C concentration within coarsely defined pools (i.e., agnostic of SOM composition) rather than representing chemical and microbial reactions within SOM pools. The depth of soil molecular and microphysical\/chemical information presents a major limitation to improving models at regional and Continental United States (CONUS) scales, where impacts of climate change are manifested and can be understood.\n\nLed by a team at the Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory (EMSL), a new decadal initiative to develop a CONUS-scale database of soil compositional, physical, and metagenomic measurements that are open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), termed the Molecular Observation Network (MONet) program. The goal of MONet is to facilitate molecular data syntheses and modelling activities that can reduce uncertainty in soil C simulation at regional and CONUS scales. In this article, we describe the 1000 Soils Pilot for MONet, which focuses on understanding the drivers and fluxes of soil C cycles through standardized molecular measurements. It represents our initial goal to collect soil cores from 1000 locations.\n\nTo highlight the power of high-resolution measurements for understanding soil structure, molecular SOM composition, and SOM decomposition, we also present a use case from the 1000 Soils Pilot. As wildfires are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide and have lasting impacts on ecosystem structure and function, we focus our use case on a set of three locations with varied burned histories. We show that wildfire may result in oxidation of SOM and in structural changes to soil pore networks that persist into deeper soils, which are not investigated by typical sampling schema. These are important considerations in the management of forest ecosystem restoration post-wildfire and present an interesting avenue for more robust investigations as the MONet database expands.\n\n# Approach\n\nThrough partnerships with individual researchers and ecological networks (**Figure 1A**), the 1000 Soils Pilot facilitated the collection of 76 sets of soil cores using a standardized sampling kit and field protocols. Collaborators collected two 30-cm (3-inch dia.) replicate intact cores using a slide hammer soil corer (AMS, Inc., USA), as well as four 10-cm (2-inch dia.) soil cores using a wooden block and mallet. Other field-based measurements included soil temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity, measured using a Teros 12 Probe and ZSC Bluetooth interface (Meter Group, Inc., USA). Soil infiltration rate was measured using the single-ring infiltrometer method. A step-by-step sampling protocol is available in the SI and at protocols.io (DOI: 10.17504\/protocols.io.5jyl8jr49g2w\/v2). After sample collection, all data was generated by EMSL or EMSL-contracted vendors. All data from the 1000 Soils Pilot are available *via* Zenodo(https:\/\/zenodo.org\/communities\/emsl-monet); )",
    "Early life\n\nBorn Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Dwan was the younger son of commercial traveler of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857–1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, née Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician.\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\n\n## Career\n\nDwan started his directing career by accident in 1911, when he was sent by his employers to California, in order to locate a company that had vanished. Dwan managed to track the company down, and learned that they were waiting for the film's director (who was an alcoholic) to return from a binge (and allowing them to return to work). Dwan wired back to his employers in Chicago, informing them of the situation, and suggested that they disband the company. They wired back, instructing Dwan to direct the film. When Dwan informed the company of the situation, and that their jobs were on the line, they responded: \"You're the best damn director we ever saw\".\nDwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California, from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood. Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 \"Lambs' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies",
    "Aristotle (əl;Collins English Dictionary Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pron; 384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.\nLittle is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (347 BC). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.\nThough Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\nAristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. He also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply \"The Philosopher\", while the poet Dante called him \"the master of those who know\". His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.\n\n\n\n## Life\n\nIn general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.\nAristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira, Chalcidice,Aristotle (Greek philosopher) about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki.p=5 His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. While he was young, Aristotle learned about biology and medical information, which was taught by his father. Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian.p=14 Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.page=4\nMieza, Macedonia, Greece\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato's Academy.pp=58–63 He probably experienced the Eleusinian Mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"to experience is to learn\" παθείν μαθεĩν.2006 Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348\/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.pp=Introduction Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married Pythias, either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. They had a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander.2016\n\"Aristotle tutoring Alexander\" by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander.pp=58–59 Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\".pp=58–59 By 335 BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira. They had a son whom Aristotle named after his father, Nicomachus. If the Suda  an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages  is accurate, he may also have had an erômenos, Palaephatus of Abydus.p=88\nPortrait bust of Aristotle; an Imperial Roman (1st or 2nd century AD) copy of a lost bronze sculpture made by Lysippos\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.1972 He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students.",
    "His most important treatises include Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, On the Soul and Poetics. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and theatre.\"2009\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death.p=460 Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322 BC, Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,pp=72–73 prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in Chalcis, on Euboea, at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\"p=216p=T44a-e – a reference to Athens's trial and execution of Socrates. He died in Chalcis, EuboeaAristotle (Greek philosopher)2009 of natural causes later that same year, having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.p=3862\n\n## Theoretical philosophy\n\n\n\n### Logic\n\nWith the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, pp=81–89 and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic. pp=1–20 Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that with Aristotle logic reached its completion. pages=Preface\n\n#### Organon\n\nWhat is today called Aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism (methods of logical argument), 2016 Aristotle himself would have labelled \"analytics\". The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean dialectics. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the Organon around 40 BC by Andronicus of Rhodes or others among his followers. page=52 The books are:\n\n# Categories\n\n# On Interpretation\n\n# Prior Analytics\n\n# Posterior Analytics\n\n# Topics\n\n# On Sophistical Refutations\nPlato (left) and Aristotle in Raphael's 1509 fresco, The School of Athens. Aristotle holds his Nicomachean Ethics and gestures to the earth, representing his view in immanent realism, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, indicating his Theory of Forms, and holds his Timaeus. School of Athens\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in On Interpretation, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) pp= 24b18–20 and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The Rhetoric is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the Topics. 2017\n\n### Metaphysics\n\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name Metaphysics. 2000 Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (theoretikē) philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his Metaphysics (1026a16):\n\n#### Substance\n\nAristotle examines the concepts of substance (ousia) and essence (to ti ên einai, \"the what it was to be\") in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called hylomorphism. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed.",
    "For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers, etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form. p=VIII 1043a 10–30\n\n##### Immanent realism\n\nPlato's forms exist as universals, like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing (hylomorphism).\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle's ontology places the universal (katholou) in particulars (kath' hekaston), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what phenomena are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance. 2000\nPlato argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When one looks at an apple, for example, one sees an apple, and one can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, one can place an apple next to a book, so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms. 2000\n\n##### Potentiality and actuality\n\nConcerning the nature of change (kinesis) and its causes, as he outlines in his Physics and On Generation and Corruption (319b–320a), he distinguishes coming-to-be (genesis, also translated as 'generation') from:\n\n# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\n\n# locomotion, which is change in space; and\n\n# alteration, which is change in quality.\n\nthe potential made actual – by learning.\nComing-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (dynamis) and actuality (entelecheia) in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) a plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and potentiality exists for the sake of the end, actuality, accordingly, is the end. Referring then to the previous example, it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do. 2000\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same. 2000\n\n### Epistemology\n\nAristotle's immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.2017 Aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction, whereas Plato relies on deduction from a priori principles.2017\n\n## Natural philosophy\n\nAristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences. 2016 In Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". However, his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.2016\n\n### Physics\n\nThe four classical elements (fire, air, water, earth) of Empedocles and Aristotle illustrated with a burning log. The log releases all four elements as it is destroyed.\n\n#### Five elements\n\nIn his On Generation and Corruption, Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles, earth, water, air, and fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planets. pages=133–139, 166–169\n\n#### Motion\n\nAristotle describes two kinds of motion: \"violent\" or \"unnatural motion\", such as that of a thrown stone, in the Physics (254b10), and \"natural motion\", such as of a falling object, in On the Heavens (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, 2016 since Aristotle does not address friction. pp=60–84 With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. 2011 This would imply the equation 2011\n: ,\nincorrect in modern physics. 2011\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens, while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places. pp=23–40\nPhysics he states that objects fall at a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in. pp=60–84 This is a correct approximation for objects in Earth's gravitational field moving in air or water. pp=23–40\nIn the Physics (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density, ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:; pp=23–40\n: \nAristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible. pp=23–40 Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the \"extreme view\" pp=60–84 that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative, pages=1–32 and passim but other authors reject this. pp=60–84\nArchimedes corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they displace enough water; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not, as Aristotle thought, its elementary composition. pp=23–40\nAristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the Early Modern period. John Philoponus (in Late antiquity) and Galileo (in Early modern period) are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. 2016 A contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli, who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the Earth's gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not pp=23–40), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium. 2011\nNewton's \"forced\" motion corresponds to Aristotle's \"violent\" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval theory of impetus. pp=23–40\n\n#### Four causes\n\nAristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that a thing takes its form from four causes: in the case of a table, the wood used (material cause), its design (formal cause), the tools and techniques used (efficient cause), and its decorative or practical purpose (final cause). pages=88–90\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term aitia is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here. pages=96–100, 106–107\n* Material cause describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino. pages=96–100, 106–107\n* The formal cause is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells one what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing. pages=96–100, 106–107\n* The efficient cause is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, non-living or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over. pages=96–100, 106–107 In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of how it develops from the egg, and how its body functions. pages=91–92, 369–373\n* The final cause (telos) is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition. pages=96–100, 106–107 In the case of living things, it implies adaptation to a particular way of life. pages=91–92, 369–373\n\n#### Optics\n\nAristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in Problems, book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image. Lahanas\n\n#### Chance and spontaneity\n\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things, \"from what is spontaneous\". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that only applies to people's moral choices. p=2.6\n\n### Astronomy\n\nIn astronomy, Aristotle refuted Democritus's claim that the Milky Way was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,\" pointing out partly correctly that if \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.\" p=1. 8 He also wrote descriptions of comets, including the Great Comet of 371 BC. Meteorology\n\n### Geology and natural sciences\n\nAristotle noted that the ground level of the Aeolian islands changed before a volcanic eruption.\nAristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations. He stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime. page=13\nThe geologist Charles Lyell noted that Aristotle described such change, including \"lakes that had dried up\" and \"deserts that had become watered by rivers\", giving as examples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer, and \"the upheaving of one of the Aeolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.\"' page=17\nAristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology (including his major writings \"Meteorologica\"). For example, he made some of the earliest observations about desalination: he observed early – and correctly – that when seawater is heated, freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff (\"I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again.\")\n\n### Biology\n\nhectocotyl arm of the octopus (bottom left).\n\n#### Empirical research\n\nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically, page=7 and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos. page=14 His data in History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, and Parts of Animals are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas. pages=196, 248 His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on botany have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived. pp=5805–5816\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the catfish, electric ray, and frogfish in detail, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus. His description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. pages=66–74, 137 He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants, pages=118–119 and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark. page=73\nHe notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the heron, which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet. pages=135–136 Darwin, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution. page=206 Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results. page=189 To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor, or that one kind can change into another, or that kinds can become extinct. page=273\n\n#### Scientific style\n\nAristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that brood size decreases with body mass, whereas gestation period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for mouse and elephant.\nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense. page=42 He used the ancient Greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection. pages=361–365 In Generation of Animals, he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside. 2011\nInstead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. pages=365–368 This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific. pages=365–368\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. page=408\n\n#### Classification of living things\n\nAristotle recorded that the embryo of a dogfish was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the yolk sac), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.pages=72–74\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals,page=35 arranging these in the History of Animals in a graded scale of perfection, a nonreligious version of the scala naturae, with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above plants, and these in turn were above minerals.pages=201–202 He grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder invertebrates as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (birds, reptiles, fish). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and shelled) and the hard-shelled molluscs (bivalves and gastropods). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is convergent evolution.pages=111–119 Philosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in taxonomy, but zoologists who studied this question in the early 21st century think otherwise. He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.pp=43–44\n\n### Psychology\n\n\n\n#### Soul\n\nstructure for souls of plants, animals, and humans, making humans unique in having all three types of soul.\nAristotle's psychology, given in his treatise On the Soul (peri psychēs), posits three kinds of soul (\"psyches\"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous (intellect) and logos (reason). pages=156–163\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement). 2016 In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. p=45 Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon. p=348\nIn On the Soul, Aristotle famously criticizes Plato's theory of the soul and develops his own in response to Plato's. The first criticism is against Plato's view of the soul in the Timaeus that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies. 20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle's interpretation of Plato and maintained that he had misunderstood Plato. Today's scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle's interpretation and have warmed up to it. Aristotle's other criticism is that Plato's view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mis-matched; in principle, Aristotle alleges, any soul can go with any body, according to Plato's theory. Aristotle's claim that the soul is the form of a living being is meant to eliminate that possibility and thus rule out reincarnation.\n\n#### Memory\n\nAccording to Aristotle in On the Soul, memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past. p=12 In other words, a memory is a mental picture (phantasm) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian Avoid wrap|'common sense', and thinking. p=61\nAristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences, both for previous experience and present experience. p=25\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself. p=30 Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed. p=25 Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression. p=19 Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. p=296\nSenses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the sensorium (the heart), linked by his laws of association (similarity, contrast, and contiguity).\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his laws of association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled. p=259\n\n#### Dreams\n\nAristotle describes sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness. pp=405–423 Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses pages=115–118 or of digestion, pp=405–23 so it is vital to the body. pages=115–118 While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, pages=115–18 albeit differently, pp=405–423 unless they are weary. pages=115–118\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner. pages=115–118 Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then looks away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. pp=405–423 When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored. pages=115–118 However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences. pp=405–423 So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience. pp=169–181 During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person. pp=405–423 This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature. pp=405–423 In De Anima iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, phantasia. 2016\nOne component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences. pages=174–184 Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences. pp=169–181\n\n## Practical philosophy\n\nAristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric. 2016\n\n### Ethics\n\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, most notably including the Nicomachean Ethics. 2001\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (ergon) of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē (soul) in accordance with reason (logos). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency2009) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well-being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (ēthikē aretē), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence. ps=  Book I. See for example chapter 7.\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher. p= Book VI\n\n### Politics\n\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled Politics. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family, which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\". pp=1253a19–124 He famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and argued that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality. pages=320–321 Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner. page=59\nAristotle's classifications of political constitutions\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (polis) which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (koinōnia). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences\". For a different reading of social and economic processes in the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics see Polanyi, Karl (1957) \"Aristotle Discovers the Economy\" in Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115.\nIn Protrepticus, the character 'Aristotle' states: p=22\nAs Plato's disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and, following the outline of certain ideas from Plato's Statesman, he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed state:\nTo illustrate this approach, Aristotle proposed a first-of-its-kind mathematical model of voting, albeit textually described, where the democratic principle of \"one voter–one vote\" is combined with the oligarchic \"merit-weighted voting\"; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see. pages=35-38\n\n### Economics\n\nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought, especially to thought in the Middle Ages. pages=20–24 In Politics, Aristotle addresses the city, property, and trade. His response to criticisms of private property, in Lionel Robbins's view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements. pages=20–24 Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from human nature. In Politics, Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money. pages=20–24 Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or silver. pages=16–28\nAristotle's discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a profit. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use. pages=16–28\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\". pages=16–28 He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\". pages=16–28\n\n### Rhetoric and poetics\n\nThe Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods (1784) by Bénigne Gagneraux. In his Poetics, Aristotle uses the tragedy Oedipus Tyrannus by Sophocles as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured, with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous, but loses everything through some hamartia (fault). pages=56–60\nAristotle's Rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ethos (an appeal to the speaker's character), pathos (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and logos (an appeal to logical reasoning). pages=109–110 He also categorizes rhetoric into three genres: epideictic (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), forensic (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and deliberative (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue). pages=3–7 Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs: enthymeme (proof by syllogism) and paradeigma (proof by example). p=71\nAristotle writes in his Poetics that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. pp=152–159 He applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention pp=152–159 and contends that the audience's realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself. pp=152–159 Aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals pp=152–159 and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\". pp=152–159 Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\" pp=152–59 For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. p=III\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's Poetics originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. p=VI The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic. p=XXVI Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop. pages=Introduction, xi–xii\n\n### Views on women\n\nAristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. The biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction, which changes her body temperature, which in turn makes her, in Aristotle's view, incapable of participating in political life. On this ground, proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny 1998 and sexism. pp=83–112 However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.\n\n## Influence\n\nMore than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. p=8 He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". page=34 Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, page=156 pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Aristotle (Greek philosopher) pages=70–77 Taneli Kukkonen, writing in The Classical Tradition, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" pages=70–77 Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\". page=86\nAristotle has been called the father of logic, biology, political science, zoology, embryology, natural law, scientific method, rhetoric, psychology, realism, criticism, individualism, teleology, and meteorology.\n\n### On his successor, Theophrastus\n\nFrontispiece to a 1644 version of Theophrastus's Historia Plantarum, originally written around 300 BC\nAristotle's pupil and successor, Theophrastus, wrote the History of Plants, a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as carpel from carpos, fruit, and pericarp, from pericarpion, seed chamber. page=219\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned. pp= 90–91\n\n### On later Greek philosophers\n\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school. Aristotle's students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?\" p= Part 1, 7:7\n\n### On Hellenistic science\n\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. page=252 It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. p= 56 Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. Ernst Mayr states that there was \"nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\" pp=90–94\n\n### On Byzantine scholars\n\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century. pages=20, 28, 35–36 John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought. pages=233–724 Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations.p=162\nAfter a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena.pp=20–21, 28–29, 393–406, 407–408\n\n### On the medieval Islamic world\n\n1220\nAristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,1998 as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. Averroes, Avicenna and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. Alkindus greatly admired Aristotle's philosophy,1989 and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the \"exemplar\" for all future philosophers.p=III, 2, 43 Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the \"First Teacher\".1998 The title was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.pp=59–60\n\n### On medieval Europe\n\nAristotle ridden by Phyllis by Hans Baldung, 1515Phyllis and Aristotle\nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from AD 600 to 1100 except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by Gerard of Cremona, 2014 and from the original Greek, such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke. After the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his Summa Theologica, working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle \"The Philosopher\",2013 the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance. 2018 These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, Peter Abelard, and John Buridan worked on Aristotelian logic. Lagerlund\nThe medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having\nA cautionary medieval tale held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king's seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Artists such as Hans Baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme. Aristotle Phyllis\nThe Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in The Divine Comedy:\nBesides Dante's fellow poets, the classical figure that most influenced the Comedy is Aristotle. Dante built up the philosophy of the Comedy with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. Dante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of Albert Magnus. Dante even acknowledges Aristotle's influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno's structure by citing the Nicomachean Ethics.\n\n### On medieval Judaism\n\nMoses Maimonides (considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval Judaism) adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his Guide for the Perplexed on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Maimonides also considered Aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived, and styled him as the \"chief of the philosophers\". Also, in his letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon, Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are \"sufficient by themselves and superior to all that were written before them. His intellect, Aristotle's is the extreme limit of human intellect, apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy, there being no level higher\".\n\n### On Early Modern scientists\n\nWilliam Harvey's De Motu Cordis, 1628, showed that the blood circulated, contrary to classical era thinking.\nIn the Early Modern period, scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought. pp=118–29 Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight. 2017\n\n### On 18th\/19th-century thinkers\n\nThe 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. p=86 Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (\"natural slaves\"),pp=102, 106–107 and the natural superiority (virtue, arete) of others. It was Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. page=265\nThe English mathematician George Boole fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided \"to go under, over, and beyond\" it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book The Laws of Thought. This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check validity, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two. 2003\nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Also, in later editions of the book \"On the Origin of Species', Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles.\nJames Joyce's favoured philosopher was Aristotle, whom he considered to be \"the greatest thinker of all times\". Samuel Taylor Coleridge said: Everybody is born either a Platonist or an Aristotelian. Ayn Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influencep=2 and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.p=12 She also regarded Aristotle as the greatest of all philosophers.\nKarl Marx considered Aristotle to be the \"greatest thinker of antiquity\", and called him a \"giant thinker\", a \"genius\", and \"the great scholar\".\n\n### Modern rejection and rehabilitation\n\npages=70–77 Illustration by fr, 1866\nDuring the 20th century, Aristotle's work was widely criticized. The philosopher Bertrand Russell\nargued that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell called Aristotle's ethics \"repulsive\", and labelled his logic \"as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy\". Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.1972\nThe Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by \"proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character\" on limited evidence from their senses.p=72 In 1985, the biologist Peter Medawar could still state in \"pure seventeenth century\"p=353 tones that Aristotle had assembled \"a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility\".p=353\nBy the start of the 21st century, however, Aristotle was taken more seriously: Kukkonen noted that \"In the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition.\"pp=70–77 Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.pp=passim Kukkonen observed, too, that \"that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander\" remained current, as in the 2004 film Alexander, while the \"firm rules\" of Aristotle's theory of drama have ensured a role for the Poetics in Hollywood.pp=70–77\nBiologists continue to be interested in Aristotle's thinking. Armand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle's biology,2015 while Niko Tinbergen's four questions, based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse animal behaviour; they examine function, phylogeny, mechanism, and ontogeny.pp=2076–2085\n\n## Surviving works\n\n\n\n### Corpus Aristotelicum\n\nFirst page of a 1566 edition of the Nicomachean Ethics in Greek and Latin\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school.p=9 Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker's Royal Prussian Academy edition (Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica, Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.Aristotelis Opera\n\n### Loss and preservation\n\nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era. His writings are divisible into two groups: the \"exoteric\", intended for the public, and the \"esoteric\", for use within the Lyceum school.p=12page=35 Aristotle's \"lost\" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication.pp= xi–xii Cicero's description of Aristotle's literary style as \"a river of gold\" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes. A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones now possessed came to be found.pages=1–69 The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.page=16\nAccording to Strabo and Plutarch, after Aristotle's death, his library and writings went to Theophrastus (Aristotle's successor as head of the Lycaeum and the Peripatetic school). After the death of Theophrastus, the peripatetic library went to Neleus of Scepsis.5\nSome time later, the Kingdom of Pergamon began conscripting books for a royal library, and the heirs of Neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose. The library was stored there for about a century and a half, in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation. On the death of Attalus III, which also ended the royal library ambitions, the existence of Aristotelian library was disclosed, and it was purchased by Apellicon and returned to Athens in about 100.pages=5–6\nApellicon sought to recover the texts, many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored. He had them copied out into new manuscripts, and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable.pages=5–6\nWhen Sulla seized Athens in 86, he seized the library and transferred it to Rome. There, Andronicus of Rhodes organized the texts into the first complete edition of Aristotle's works (and works attributed to him). The Aristotelian texts we have to day are based on these.pages=6–8\n\n## Legacy\n\n\n\n### Depictions\n\nPaintings\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Elder Justus van Gent, Raphael, Paolo Veronese, Jusepe de Ribera, 2005 Rembrandt, 2002 and Francesco Hayez over the centuries. Among the best-known depictions is Raphael's fresco The School of Athens, in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, where the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image, at the architectural vanishing point, reflecting their importance. 2002 Rembrandt's Aristotle with a Bust of Homer, too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic Jonathan Jones writes, \"this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time.\"1969\nAristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg| Nuremberg Chronicle anachronistically shows Aristotle in a medieval scholar's clothing.

    "Studies in the United States have indicated that maternal first trimester smoking and infant transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) locus mutations are associated with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) and that a synergistic effect of these two risk factors occurs. Based on a Danish case-control study of CLP, the authors studied the effects of smoking and TGFA alleles in an ethnically homogeneous setting. Interview information was obtained for mothers of 302 CLP cases (96% of eligible) and for 567 mothers of nonmalformed children (94% of eligible). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that smoking was associated with a moderately increased risk of cleft lip +/- cleft palate (CL(P)) (odds ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval 0.99-2.00). No association between smoking and isolated cleft palate (CP) was observed. TGFA genotype was not associated with either CL(P) or CP, and no synergistic effect with smoking was observed. The \"rare\" TGFA allele occurred in 25% of both cases and controls compared with an average of 14% in other white control groups. Furthermore, the frequency of CLP in Scandinavia is among the highest in the world. Hence, it is possible that the previously reported association between TGFA and CLP to some degree can be attributable to confounding by ethnicity.",
    "The ablation amount for entire ice cliffs reaches about 20% of that at the whole debris-covered area; the ablation rate at the ice cliff mainly depends on shortwave radiation, which differs widely with the orientation of an ice cliff. Therefore, the distribution of ice cliffs in relation to their orientation was observed on a debris-covered glacier. The south-facing cliffs were small in area because they have low slope angles and tended to be covered with debris. The north-facing cliffs, on the other hand, were large in the studied area and maintain a slope angle larger than the repose angle of debris. They, therefore, are stable. Longwave radiation from the debris surface opposite the ice cliffs was larger on the lower portion of ice cliffs than on the upper portion in every azimuth. This difference in longwave radiation maintained a steep slope angle on ice cliff. Shortwave radiation was stronger at the upper portion of ice cliffs than at the lower portion due to the local shading effect, causing gentle sloping of ice cliffs. This was especially pronounced at cliffs facing to south. Therefore, the dependency of the ice cliff angle in orientation can be explained by the difference in local radiation between the upper and lower portion of the ice cliff.",
